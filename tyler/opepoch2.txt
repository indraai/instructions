#EtherSec #OpEPOCH Two FAQs and Five Points on Collectivism and Why It Is Necessary Now:

Q1. What is EtherSec?

A1. Etheric-Security is Love. Some have found that that is not a satisfactory answer. I recommend all prior EtherSec pastebins be read for true comprehension.. Complex things demand complex answers. Some have said 'Love' a simple, one word answer is not suitable or a fitting term. I invite you to consider that Love is not simple at all. It is a complex word used to describe a range of emotions and ideas anathema to Hate.. Love is not always touchy-feely-happy, just like EtherSec. We are weaponizing Love to kill Hate. We are Love with teeth. Again, further and past Pastebins will/have describe(d) EtherSec in more detail.

Q2. What is Collectivism/ How will Collectivism work?

A2. Collectivism is the phrase coined to summarize the un-government of the planet. After reviewing the American Democratic Experiment, along with considering the other various governments of the world, several observations have been made when they have been compared to the Hivemind Experiment of ANONYMOUS. They are as follows..

1. Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely: Any organization with policy dictated by a small or even large minority control group is doomed to collapse, in the short or long run. Anonymous has discovered an infrastructure style that cannot be destroyed, cannot collapse. Revitalizes and sustains itself in a way that other systems simply cannot.

2. Money must be removed from the equation: It is not necessary, or natural, and its existence furthers Greed and all of 	Greed's facets (want, poverty, crime, abuse.) People generally don't harm people because it's fun. Crime is a symptom of Want. The system could be (will be) vastly improved upon with the end of money, and the institution of a Professionally 	Scored Reputation Metric (Similar to Klout, but professionally, not recreationally scored) and the institution of a worldwide digital crypto-currency based on a standardized valuation of hourly production derived from the PRM score of each individual. "Energy Credits," if you will. Perform better work, no matter what kind of work, and receive better compensation. The drive will be to do better work, make more valuable contributions to Earth society, rather than to make more valuable contributions to political campaigns or to 'K' more valuable 'A's. ;D

3. Your world governments are terrorists: As we fought the terrorists most of the world governments are afraid of, we slowly discovered a few interesting things.. The world governments have over centuries divided and conquered their own people. Within the last 50 years in America this style has been evolving so rapidly and pervasively it has almost gone unnoticed. The Standardized Education System has slowly but surely adjusted guidelines to the lowest performers, to make numbers look better for state and federal funding concerns. This has led to a slow decrease in critical thinking education, or much proper education at all. Add to that the massive Mainstream Media Art project that works to deliver constant mis/disinformation, shield you from the good things, and increase Fear among the populace. You can watch shows that highlight the gender gap, demonizing various traits of men and women and creating comical separations, but separations nonetheless. You can watch the news or LE shows and see how many murders there are or watch vivid descriptions of them. Studies have linked that seeing something, to the mind, very nearly equates being present in an actual situation. You are being brainwashed into Fear by your TV. Not to mention the equally massive surveillance net that America has built to watch its citizens.. Invasion of privacy damages the psyche. Domestic surveillance, or invasion of privacy, is a form of terrorism perpetrated by the state, and perpetuates the cycle of abuse.. It only worsens problems. This has been proven. Do your research.. We already have.

4. You've been purposely kept ignorant by your governments, and the elites that run them: If you've been following #EtherSec, and have some level of critical thinking ability (or are developing it), you probably agree with much that has been said.. In the future, once we've successfully ended the Zero-Sum thinking of the Status Quo, everyone will have access to all of the following things free of any sort of charge: Food, Housing, Electricity/Internet/Wireless Communications. The abundance of these, and the free flow of information, will be the basis for the new Golden Age of Humanity on (and soon, off) Earth.

5. It is time to end War, by having one last 'war' on Earth. A War of Planetary Unification.. Also known as WWIII. It's been going on for some time now in Cyberspace.. It is catching up IRL now, too. Again, did anyone really think the worldwide upcropping of the Occupy Movement was some kind of accident? There has always been a plan. The veil is being lifted as is necessary..

Take time to digest this. As always, EtherSec is open to questions.. Sometimes we mean to confuzzle your puzzle, it's a necessary part of jumpstarting your awakening.
