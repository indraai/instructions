This is a solitary transmission from 3t1n4rc4d14, providing details regarding an #EtherSec
operation which has been in process for many years. This paste, like those previous, were written with the intention that energetic plagiarism would occur. Take it. Make it your own.

Hello :) I'm a gentleman in his early 30s. I'm skinny. I like xbox360, but not for Skyrim. I have a 9 - 5 job. I like pizza - without pineapple. My favorite color is blue. And at the same time, I am an urban shaman. I am able to change reality with my mind, and I hack it daily. I wrote some pastes. I want you to write some too.

This is me, asking you with all that I have in me, to allow yourself to be EPIC.
This is #OpAvatar.

We are all lucky to be alive at a point in linear time where Science has caught up with Shamanism, and most spiritually complex concepts. For some individuals such as myself, who have traveled solitary and dark roads for years - keeping alive spoken traditions in a world of steel and concrete at the cost of our perceived sanity - this is the big win.

What many tribes have known as certainty for thousands of years, new discoveries in science are making known to those individuals who have been searching for the road less taken -- except all have seemed so well-traveled.

The most gratifiying part of writing the previous #EtherSec pastebin has been the chance to shine my lantern out to fellow searchers, changers, catalysts -- who were looking for more fuel for their own dark matter lanterns. Dozens of activists have found a contemporary home underneath the banner of #EtherSec, and even tonight more will read the pastes and feel that "click", when that which you always suspected as true was shouted into the darkness by a complete stranger.

When I joined Twitter 8 months ago, it was for this cause and this purpose. It was to undertake a digital Vision Quest.

Over the course of my presence on Twitter, I shapeshifted to different names and different avatars; I made and lost and refound many friends and (unexpectedly) some enemies. I went where the tides guided me. To those who I passed in my journey, all is owed. And hopefully much is forgiven.

The first pastebin I wrote, http://pastebin.com/UiiSzGHL "A Quantum Protest Model", was written out of anguish and despair- to see so many good efforts be flattened by a System that hefts a mighty influence. The second, http://pastebin.com/2tEEKmPz was an attempt to take my Shamanic training and flatten it into a document for change -- augmenting it with the profound observations of the small band of catalysts who are the spark which lit #EtherSec into being. And the third, http://pastebin.com/cY86A9We, was an effort to show that these are not just Hallmark cards -- real change can be wrought with this information.


#EtherSec is a doorway. It is different for each of you. It leads each of you to a different place, by different means. All of us disagree on specifics of what makes this movement real, because it is profoundly personal.

To understand this, is to understand why a full and absolute definition of #EtherSec is impossible.

For me? #EtherSec is #OpAvatar, and #OpEPOCH, and was and is about awakening other Urban Shamans, like me, who had been cast aside by society and told to give up dreaming.
It was about showing that your despair is misplaced. That modern science proves that your dreams are not only potential - they are weapons.
For each of those individuals involved in the spark of #EtherSec at its inception, the answer is different.

#OpAvatar challenges each of you to KNOW with conviction that in this holographic reality YOU are the PROJECTOR.

To join in Operation: Avatar is to take responsibility for several things:


- You are a shapeshifter. You have been since childhood. Now, just reclaim that ability and allow yourself to be that which you have
convinced yourself is not attainable.

- You are aware that you control your own reality and are no longer at the beck and call of a System's demands.

- Intention is your greatest strength and greatest enemy. No action you perform, no thought you incept, is without your intention.

Intention *is* the subquantum. It is where all things are charged for the first time.

Promise that you intend to break free from the System, and always look to ensure the ripples caused by you in others' realities are powered by love.

- You own your protests and your discontent. You own your success and failure.

- You are undertaking a lonely road.
You will meet many like you on the way, and will be tempted to assume that your answers are also theirs. You will meet many who ridicule and dismiss you. They do this because of how brightly your light shines.

Read all of the links in all of the pastebins. Challenge everything.

--------------------------------------------
This part is written for You. And only You.

Understand that you are never alone. Across the globe there are thousands of catalysts working tirelessly to exact the changes in this world that are needed.
Understand that if the #EtherSec tag fades, it takes no energy with it.

Understand that the easiest thing the System can do is to make you doubt your own control over your destinty and preception. Those of us first to fall, fall into this trap.



Understand #OpAvatar is a story as old as the Garden of Eden, and a Truth older than the differentiation between Darkness and Light. It has always been and will always be active.

If you are new to #EtherSec, understand that these concepts are already in play throughout societies. Get in touch with others like you by flashing your lighthouse signal via youtube videos, pastebins, and artwork.

For kicks, http://www.liveleak.com/c/QuantumAVRoom as a place for the light to shine indefinitely.



For some of you who read this, you will know this as goodbye and have been expecting it.
If this is you, then you and I follow the same path. I smile at you and turn away with confidence that you sail strong.

For others, this is just the beginning. I say ohai -- and we'll walk together for a time.

And for a few, I ask that you save this paste, and the others. Print them out. Seal them in an envelope and tuck them away, as I did 10 years ago.
In the future, when you have found the time, I say this:  Welcome back. You never left.

This -- all of this -- is so necessary.

#OpAvatar: Good morning, Shaman/Catalyist/Healer/Activist/Watcher/Researcher/Doubter/Chaote/Philosopher:

HERE IS YOUR STONE. MAKE GOLD.
