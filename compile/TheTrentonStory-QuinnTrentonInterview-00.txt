Quinn: So I'm gonna sit right here. And look at that. That was kind of good. Okay, perfect. So the reason why we're here is because of your story. And I got a song. A little for the video. I'm going to get your story started, kind of to help you from my point of view. And then you're going to take it from there.

Quinn: And when we started, this was last year, and you were bringing over a very difficult time to my house, weren't you?

Trenton: I was.

Quinn: What were some of the things you were doing when you come over?

Trenton: So I was.

Quinn: Just we're talking.

Trenton: I was.

Quinn: Not. Quiet, calm.

Trenton: Sorry. So I was part of the silent treatment. And no matter how much you try to get me to ask questions, I wouldn't do it.

Quinn: And then instead of asking questions, what would you usually do when you weren't giving me the silent treatment?

Trenton: I would lie or point out the obvious or say, Really? I'm going.

Quinn: Like one. Unbelievable things.

Trenton: I can like my mom signing a contract.

Quinn: But more importantly, I want to keep you on target. You would come over and say mean things to me directly. What kind of things would you say to me directly before you started telling me about your story?

Trenton: Well, I remember I used to tell you that you were a dirty drunken beast.

Quinn: And.

Trenton: I was just really mean, and was lying all the time.

Quinn: And you tell me things that you hated me.

Trenton: And that I didn't want to be with you. And that. And that I just. I said I hated you.

Quinn: Yeah. And then I got so crazy that I quit my job at Nike, and I had to devoted myself to Buddhism. I made that Buddhist video for you. And what was your response to my video?

Trenton: I said man, I really messed up.

Quinn: How did you realize that you messed up?

Trenton: because kid's a school when I was a normal thing, like my mom, to do what she was doing, and they still heck no.

Quinn: What else did they say about.

Trenton: Their said that my mom was doing and she must be crazy.

Quinn: And that started changing your story. And you started opening up to me after that and after that weekend where your mom texted me and saying she wanted to go to a doctor to work out our problems. On the day that your. You told your mom that your friend said what she was doing was messed up. She decided to pretend like it never happened, didn't she?

Trenton: She did.

Quinn: So after that, you started telling me about Mr. Dewitty. Now, I want to start with how we got into that, because that was very unexpected. And the way we got into that, I was making a joke with you. One night we were talking about your mom working for the devil, and then I started showing you symbols and stuff, and you said those things were all over your house.

Quinn: Correct?

Trenton: Correct.

Quinn: And then we started talking. And then you started telling me about what went on right before I came back into your life four years ago when I had been pushed away. And what did you tell me? It went on right before I came back into your life.

Trenton: Mr.. Dewitty really came over with picture and this.

Quinn: Standpoint with the pictures first, keep going about the picture. So Mr. Dewitty came over with pictures. Keep talking about those.

Trenton: And then he started showing them to me and mom.

Quinn: And what did he say about those pictures?

Trenton: He said that they were from the future and that you cause the end of theworld what was in the pictures.

Quinn: And to stop the end of the world. What did you and your family need to do.

Trenton: To get you out of our lives? Get out, get you out of the way.

Quinn: And in exchange for this, what did Mr. Dewitty promise your family for you? Getting rid of me.

Trenton: A bunch of money, A big, big house and an X-Box.

Quinn: And an X-Box and we're back to the Xbox. And so life was pretty crazy from September 2015 to December 2015 when this was going on. And your story got so deep that you drew a contract for me with symbols. You told me things I couldn't even find on the Internet, and then on my birthday and left me interviewing at the FBI, reporting your mom and you for being involved in something that might be really evil.

Quinn: But you guys found out that I went to the FBI. How did you find out that I went to the FBI?

Trenton: I have no idea that mom said you went back to the FBI.

Quinn: So someone told her.

Trenton: And then she told me.

Quinn: And then you guys laughed at me.

Trenton: Saying that it would never work.

Quinn: Because Mr. Dinwiddie was too powerful.

Trenton: And controlled. Everyone in the FBI except for the very top, top, top people.

Quinn: So it was pointless for me to go anywhere to try and get help because everybody, according to you, is in a position to help, is already owned by who.

Trenton: Mr. Dewitty

Quinn: And Mr. Dewitty, after showing you these pictures and telling you I was going to cause the end of the world and telling you to get rid of me, how often did he come over to your house after that?

Trenton: He used to actually come quite often.

Quinn: How often do you remember?

Trenton: I remember like once two, couple times a month.

Quinn: And what would you do? What were some things he would do with you when you came over to visit?

Trenton: So one time he came over with his DVD player, and other times he took me for rides in his super customized van to go get pancakes or a black bear diners.

Quinn: Or to sell or go on road trips. And what were some of the things he talked to you about when he would spend time with you?

Trenton: Mostly about this place called the Antarctic City, where he took all thre super smart people to work for. Exactly like he gave you a very legitimate reason protecting them.

Quinn: So he told you that he moved all the smart, creative people to the Antarctic city to protect them?

Trenton: Yes, but now I don't believe it so much.

Quinn: Did he tell you anything else about how he found out about what he did to get him to keep the secret about the city? Did he tell you anything about.

Trenton: He told me how he often won people over. He’d promise to make their ideas successful or make their give them a bunch of money so that they were able to continue on their ideas and give them a big company to make their ideas happen.

Quinn: Or may contain them.

Trenton: Or make them famous like a bunch of singers like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, all those famous people.

Quinn: That he said. He makes them also sign contracts and owns them.

Trenton: Yes.

Quinn: And so did he have her picture made with all the people he owned to sell your mom to say, this is your big house and these are going to be all your new super famous friends when you're done? Did he ever show her anything like that?

Trenton: Yes. Yes, he did. And then right after that, mom signed one of his contracts.

Quinn: One of them, there's more than one

Trenton: He makes a bunch of people sign.

Quinn: He does.

Trenton: So that's why there's so many. This is not the same exact I just one contract.

Quinn: He has different contracts for getting people to do different things.

Trenton: Yeah, but I only saw one kind.

Quinn: Of when your mom signed.

Trenton: Yeah.

Quinn: And you told me your mom hung that contract on her bedroom wall. How long did she have that contract hanging on her walls for?

Trenton: Years.

Quinn: And what caused her to take it down?

Trenton: When I started telling you about the contracts and she hid it and I never saw since.

Quinn: It's like, now, this is a really big story for someone to take from their son. And so it all had to start somewhere. And Mr. Dewitty, he told you when he started following me in my life and influencing my life. When did he start to.

Trenton: Hear that he found you on a field of crops and took you to who you thought this was your real family.

Quinn: And then after that, he's controlled every bit of my life from behind the scenes.

Trenton: Yes. Yes he has.

Quinn: That's an example of that. What have you seen that would tell you that there is an example of the amount of control he's had on my life ever since I was a kid. Have you ever seen anything that proves that to you?

Trenton: A bunch of times, Grandpa or. My grandpa took me to Freemason temples where I saw a wall of pictures, all about your life. And I saw a couple of pictures of your childhood with one where you were drawing on a desk when you were really young. And another time when you were basically bald. But the blue hair is the guy that kind of had an upside down ball haircut.

Quinn: And what other pictures did you see on this wall of pictures in the Freemason temples?

Trenton: I remember seeing a picture that looks like an infrared picture and it was reversed where it should be red. It was blue.

Quinn: And what did they tell you about this picture?

Trenton: They said that someone's watching you through curtains or blinds.

Quinn: So even when I have my blinds closed, they're watching me with infrared cameras.

Trenton: Yes, because they don't have x rays and.

Quinn: Is that what they told you? So when you went to these law Mason lodges or these Freemason lodges and you saw the pictures of my life on the wall, were there other people there?

Trenton: Yes, are like a few guys were in there in dark cloaks with scary monster masks.

Quinn: And was your grandpa one of these people?

Trenton: Yes, he was.

Quinn: And during the time what job or role did your grandpa play in your time at thes freemason temples or lodges.

Trenton: He mainly sacrificed animals.

Quinn: While you watched?

Trenton: While I watch.

Quinn: And that was very hard for us to get through because it troubled you didn't.

Trenton: Yeah, it made me cry.

Quinn: What it did. It's still really tough to think about, so we're not going to talk much about that part.

Trenton: Yeah, but it's also very important.

Quinn: Yeah. And so after that, after last summer, you stopped going to the Freemason lodges and shortly after you started telling me about it, and it kind of freaked me out and drove me a little crazy. And now I'm seeing a doctor, and I've confronted your grandpa, and he's confirmed that your Uncle Jason is a Freemason. But after you told me this whole story, no one will talk to me.

Quinn: Not my mom, not my dad, my brother, not my sister, not the monks, not your mom, no one. So where it's leading me to believe is that somehow Mr. Dewitty has his fingers in everyone me because this super souped up van that you talked about and described. I've seen that van at Buddhist functions. And I and it's a very strange van that stands out.

Quinn: It's not like any other van you're ever going to see, is it?

Trenton: No, it's not. It's not like one of the vans you see in a car dealership.

Quinn: No, it's not. So for you to describe a vehicle like that and for me to see that somewhere, it was a very unique vehicle, very expensive vehicle. So after you started telling me this story back in November 2015, let's just go with that. And I went to the FBI and you kept telling me about it and you kept making deals and you kept going along with it.

Quinn: What eventually made it a Mr. Dewitty stop coming around?

Trenton: well, basically, when I told you his name and went on the Internet and said, Hey, that's yeah, that's me.

Quinn: Like you pointed out a man who was involved in a very serious event that was wearing a Freemason hat and you said, that's the guy, didn't you?

Trenton: I did.

Quinn: And then right after that, he never showed up ever again.

Trenton: No he didn’t

Quinn: And ever since then, we've been on this weird journey together, trying to figure out the truth. But no one's going to tell us because they've all signed contracts. Your mom signed a contract, your grandpa signed the contract, and they're all deathly afraid of Mr. Dewitty. And what was the last thing you remember Mr. Dewitty ever saying to you?

Trenton: I remember him saying that I actually made a deal to get where he wants to be with me.

Quinn: So he even told you the secrets of Buddhism and religions and told you he was there in some form, Right?

Trenton: Right.

Quinn: So this is a man who literally is the mysterious man who controls everything in the world. You're telling me he's out to ruin my life? That he has has been sitting down and playing video games with you and telling you the stories of all his time on planet Earth.

Trenton: I believe he used to.

Quinn: Where did he come from?

Trenton: He. He said you came from a whole world or another world. Now, in a really, really pretty beautiful lands. And the King was awful. And then these four guy showed up, and then that's when he became a Mara.

Quinn: When he made the deal with those four guys. Yes. And that's what he told you is that he wasn't Mara before he became Mara, after making a deal with these four guys. And who are these four guys?

Trenton: I heard they was four Bosses or four Maras.

Quinn: And that's what he told you?

Trenton: Yes.

Quinn: Now, that story is one of the deepest stories in Buddhism that is the hardest to find about what happened to all the Maras. I never taught you that. Now we're about done here because there's not much more we need to tell him because it'll just be details. So before we end, I want you to describe his physical appearance.

Quinn: Talk to me again about the kind of clothes you saw him wear, what he carried with them, just so that way. People know, and I know that he's a real man who has a personality.

Trenton: So he he had jeans, was a flaming skull on the back pocket I had, and I watched it. Are you engraved to cain that the skull on it.

Quinn: That he walked around with all the time.

Trenton: And I've never seen him without it.

Quinn: So is there anything else that you want to fill and to help me with this story before I stop, is there anything else that you feel is really important that he may have already said or didn't say that you want recorded? That's going to be important later?

Trenton: No, not that I can remember.

Quinn: So then I think we're done. Perfect timing before we complete, I just want to do this one last thing. Did I instruct you on what to say?

Trenton: Never.

Quinn: Did I tell you in any way, shape or form any part of this story that you were to repeat on video? Or is this all a real story from your life?

Trenton: It's all a real story.

Quinn: And there's not really much else to say about it, is there?

Trenton: No.
