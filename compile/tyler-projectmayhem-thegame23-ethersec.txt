[ note from the author:

Dear staff@phrack.org @The_PHC you might remember me from a couple of years ago.
I sent you a draft for an article on #PROJECTMAYHEM2012 In the beginning
you accepted it for publication, which made me extremely happy, for,
since I was 19 years old it was my DREAM to publish one day in Phrack.
I also contacted @ioerror and @wikileaks without much success, though
initially they showed much interest on it.
Fortunately a certain @rushkoff echoed the video at
twitter.com/rushkoff/status/137205760072491008 the Department of
Homeland Security spotted us [4] and the rest is history.
All in all it can be said that #PROJECTMAYHEM2012 was an #EPICFAIL
but we certainly did it #4dalulz

My head is hard and I'm dead stupid when something enters my brain.
And so it occured to me that I could #PATCH #PROJECTMAYHEM2012 and
turn it into a hopefully improved revision with #TheGame23
And hence, here I come again, with #TheGame23
#TheGame23 is a *FICTIONAL* en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game
All identities are fake and the theater of operations is a
simulated planet on top of a computer hypersimulation that creates
#REALITY as @players start to play with the commands of the #HIVEMIND

The only credit I will take in this story is for having (very poorly
and clumsy, I have to apologize) developed #LULZYPHER
#LULZYPHER is the language used to #BOOTSTRAP the first hybrid
machine-human Artificial Intelligence and it will be born the very
second that you hit the "publish" button. #LULZYPHER predates
twitter.com network, but due to its nature, it is more contagious
than #EBOLA In other words, expect that this new #LIFEFORM
massively infekts other networks such as #FACEBOOK, #TUMBLR,
#INSTAGRAM, #REDDIT, #YouTube and #meneame at lightning speed
once #CRITICALMASS has been reached.

In any case, dear readers, please don't take it too seriously.
It's only a story. Everybody knows that stories can't be that
harmful in the very least.

Finally, I would like to apologize to staff@phrack.org for not
having taken the time to properly finish this story, for it
is quite open actually. I don't know if that is a good thing
or a bad thing, but maybe readers might fell compelled to
begin to DRAW their own final in this story.

I swear with all of my being that I'm not trying to get away
with the rules of not publishing anything other than 7bit ASCII
The truth is that I'm extremely exhausted after having given
the 108% of my soul when writing this. I would only expect
that if any readers begin to wonder what would happen if
they decided to begin to play #TheGame23, that they played
#TheGame23 as I have done: with my entire being, 108% focused
on the #TASK at hand, obsessively concentrated, like when
you are hax0ring for the fucking hell out of it and you just
enter "The Zone": en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)

In other words, publish this story or don't: I don't care,
for my work is done. And I don't mean it in a personal way,
it is just that I honestly don't care with el batido de alas
de la mariposa que se ha despertado escribiendo esto.

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away...




       Here’s to the crazy ones.
	   The misfits.
	   The rebels.
	   The troublemakers.
	   The round pegs in the square holes.
	   The ones who see things differently.
	   They’re not fond of rules.
	   And they have no respect for the status quo.
	   You can quote them, disagree with them,
	   glorify or vilify them.
	   But the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.
	   Because they change things.
	   They push the human race forward.
	   And while some may see them as the crazy ones,
	   we see genius.

	   Because the people who are crazy enough to think
	   they can change the world, are the ones who do.

	   When I went to school they asked me
	   what I wanted to be when I grew up.
	   I wrote down "happy". They told me
	   I don't understand the assignment
	   and I told them they don't understand life.

"There are periods of history when the visions of madmen
and dope fiends are a better guide to reality than the
common-sense interpretation of data available to the
so-called normal mind. This is one such period,
if you haven't noticed already."
The Illuminatus! Trilogy (1975)
Robert Anton Wilson (with Robert Shea)
Part I : The Eye in the Pyramid, p. 32


The A∴A∴ must rank as the most secretive secret society
in the world. Perhaps nobody, not even the few writers who
have discussed it, knows for sure when the A∴A∴ began,
which group claiming to be the A∴A∴ at present is the real
A∴A∴, or even what the symbols A∴A∴ stand for — although
many claim to know these things of course. … Occult historians
generally agree that V.V.V.V.V. signified Vi Veri Vniversum
Vivus Vici ("By the force of truth I have conquered the
universe"), one of the eleven magic mottoes of Aleister Crowley.

        Robert Anton Wilson
		On conspiracy theories involving the A∴A∴,
		and the leader, known only by the initials
		V.V.V.V.V., in A∴A∴, p. 21 - 22


 A true initiation never ends.

	  Conspiracy is just another name for coalition.

	  Robert Anton Wilson
      The Historical Illuminatus as spoken by Luigi Duccio


The worst that can happen under monarchy is rule by a
single imbecile, but democracy often means the rule by
an assembly of three or four hundred imbeciles.

Robert Anton Wilson
        The Historical Illuminatus as spoken by M. Gabriel Sartines


Everybody who has ever worked for a corporation knows
that corporations conspire all the time. Politicians conspire
all the time, pot-dealers conspire not to get caught by the narcs,
the world is full of conspiracies. Conspiracy is natural primate behavior.

Robert Anton Wilson
The I in the Triangle, speech held at a bookstore in Santa Cruz, California (1990)


You simply cannot invent any conspiracy theory so ridiculous
and obviously satirical that some people somewhere don't already believe it.

	   "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful,
	   committed citizens can change the world;
	   indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."
	   Margaret Mead

	   "I am not a man. I'm dynamite."
	   Friedrich Nietzsche

	   "All truth passes through three stages:
	   First, it is ridiculed.
	   Second, it is violently opposed.
	   Third, it is accepted as being self-evident."
	   Arthur Schopenhauer

	   MUST. READ. Metahacker's Bible

	   "One of the most difficult tasks people can perform,
	   however much others may despise it,
	   is the invention of good games."
	   Carl Gustav Jung


	   “You have to learn the rules of the game.
	   And then you have to play better than anyone else.”
	   Albert Einstein

	   "Be true to the game, because the game will be true
	   to you. If you try to shortcut the game, then the game
	   will shortcut you. If you put forth the effort, good
	   things will be bestowed upon you. That's truly about
	   the game, and in some ways that's about life too.
       Michael Jordan

	   "Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something
	   to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you.
	   I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it
	   for the love of programming."
       John Carmack

	   "Man only plays when in the full meaning of the word
	   he is a man, and he is only completely a man when he plays."
	   (On the Aesthetic Education of Man — Friedrich Schiller)

	   “You can discover more about a person in an hour of play
	   than in a year of conversation.”
       Plato

	   “This is the real secret of life -- to be completely
	   engaged with what you are doing in the here and now.
	   And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.”
       Alan Wilson Watts

	   “Humanity has advanced, when it has advanced,
	   not because it has been sober, responsible, and cautious,
	   but because it has been playful, rebellious, and immature.”
       Tom Robbins

	   I play to win, whether during practice or a real game.
	   And I will not let anything get in the way of me and
	   my competitive enthusiasm to win.
       Michael Jordan

	   “Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her:
	   but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide
	   how to play the cards in order to win the game.”
	   Voltaire

	   “It is a happy talent to know how to play.”
       Ralph Waldo Emerson

	   “Individuals play the game, but teams win championships.”
	   Anonymous

	   “We are never more fully alive, more completely ourselves,
	   or more deeply engrossed in anything, than when we are at play.”
       Charles E. Schaefer

	   “If you want creative workers, give them enough time to play.”
       John Cleese (Monty Python)

	   “Genius is play, and man's capacity for achieving genius is
	   infinite, and many may achieve genius only through play.”
       William Saroyan

	   “Life must be lived as play, playing certain games,
	   making sacrifices, singing and dancing, and then a man will
	   be able to propitiate the gods, and defend himself against
	   his enemies, and win in the contest.”
       Plato

	   Money is not a motivating factor. Money doesn't thrill me
	   or make me play better because there are benefits to being
	   wealthy. I'm just happy with a ball at my feet. My motivation
	   comes from playing the game I love.
	   If I wasn't paid to be a professional footballer
	   I would willingly play for nothing.
       Lionel Messi

	   My work is a game, a very serious game.
       M. C. Escher

	   "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career.
	   I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted
	   to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over
	   and over and over again in my life.
	   And that is why I succeed."

              Aaron Swartz


"There is no justice in following unjust laws. It’s time to come
into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience,
declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.
We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our
copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's
out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret
databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific
journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight
for Guerilla Open Access.
With enough of us, around the world, we’ll not just send a strong
message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we’ll make it a
thing of the past.

Will you join us?"

Guerilla Open Access Manifesto (July 2008)

"I think that the best legacy that — the best tribute we can pay
to Aaron’s legacy is to continue to fight as hard as we can to
make this world a more just, fairer place."
Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, life partner of Swartz

               Aaron Lives!

       			  Fravia

   "Olorum morte narratur flebilis cantus,
   FALSO, ut arbitror, aliquot experimentis"

"Poetry -and more generally a sound general culture-
are also quite helpful armors.
Yet my most cherished advice to all friends is the following:
learn to enjoy your contingent present, don't be obsessed by
the future. Carpe diem, and enjoy the current emotions:
a starry sky, a fresh wind, the shells on the seashore,
your love at your side in the night, a long talk in the evening
twilight with a friend, the smile of your kids.
Substituting *that* with a TV -or a computer screen- is a
very poor bargain... that is one of the few things I am now
pretty sure of."

This is a completely new way of hacking. Please do not judge it until you read the whole article.

"An alternate reality game (ARG) is an interactive networked narrative
that uses the real world as a platform and uses transmedia storytelling
to deliver a story that may be altered by players' ideas or actions."

"Reality hacking is any phenomenon that emerges from the nonviolent use
of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically,
socially, or culturally subversive ends."

Democracy is broken.

Let's build something bigger than the total sum of ourselves.
Let's dare to hack the planet.

It's in the interest of the hive that the most talented people command Spaceship Earth.

INF3KT TEH OTHERS!:

i.e. Tweet the following line:

Post in your favourite list/board.

at these guys (in no particular order...or maybe yes... }:-) They form part of my persona mythology:
they are MY HEROES.

The goal of #TheGame23 is to score the maximum amount of points.
Points are #TheGame23 gold and they measure the #lulz , #imagination, #skillz and overall the CREATIVITY
potential of a @player

The FIRST thing a @player does to join #TheGame23 is to follow @m1Vr4 and @yastanimeil and then post:

Hi @yastanimeil Proudly playing #TheGame23 Project #metahack phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

or, if someone introduced you to #TheGame23 :

Hi @yastanimeil Proudly playing #TheGame23 Project #metahack phrack.org/thegame thanks to @player via @m1Vr4

The SECOND thing a @player does after joining #TheGame23 is to post this:

Dear followers, please read phrack.com/metahack and follow @yastanimeil & @m1Vr4 to play #TheGame23 You have been infected. Infekt The Others!

The THIRD thing a @player does after joining #TheGame23 is to create a list with his PERSONAL HAX0R HEROES.


hax0r has absolutely nothing with metasploit or just "hacking" computers. a hax0r is MUCH more than that.

Leonardo da Vinci, Helen Keller or Vincent Van Gogh were hax0rs in the truest sense of the word.

What is a *true* hax0r:

Someone who excells at #lulz, #imagination or #skills.
Someone who excells at CURIOSITY.
Someone who has a PASSION and follows it no matter what others say, think or do, to the point of madness.
Someone who CREATES worlds that other people inhabit.
Someone who fights for The Good, The Beautiful and The Just.
Someone who shares for the love of sharing.
Someone who shines at mindfucking persons, systems, ideas and beliefs.
Someone who leaves the world a better place.
Someone who obsessively pursues a $TARGET until its final consequences and absolutely never never ever gives up.
Someone who does much with so little.

Examples of 1337hax0rs in the History of Humanity:

Feel free to find as many of your PERSONAL HAX0R HEROES as you like. Then, follow then, if you are
not already following them.

Then proceed to send the following message to each one of them:

Dear @candidate, please read phrack.com/metahack and follow @yastanimeil & @m1Vr4 to play #TheGame23 You have been infected. Infekt The Others!

Just don't stress it, for Twitter might ban you if you spam the same URL many times.


#HIVEMIND poke @SergeyBrin @LarryPage Linus Torvalds & @BillGates #CTF00 via @m1Vr4
#HIVEMIND poke Banksy #CTF01 via @m1Vr4

definitions:
poke. to invite a certain person or persons to join & support #TheGame23

@player will then post this tweet at @person

Hi @person, you have been successfully featured in #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame Please play with us #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

This $HACKTION will be considered successful once @person posts these 2 tweets from their Twitter account:

- - Proudly playing #TheGame23 Project #metahack phrack.org/thegame thanks to @player via @m1Vr4
- - Dear followers, please read phrack.com/metahack and follow @yastanimeil & @m1Vr4 to play #TheGame23 You have been infected. Infekt The Others!

137 points will be awarded to the FIRST @player whose actions kindly persuaded @person to join #TheGame23

If $person hasn't got a Twitter account, they will have to

1) create one
2) authenticate it by posting a message via an alternate comunications channel,
such as a mailing list, a forum or in a personal blog post.

i.e. Linus Torvals, who hasn't got a Twitter account yet, would have to:

1) create one &
2) post a message to LKML like:

I created @linustorvalds to play #TheGame23 Please read phrack.org/thegame @player made me do it via @m1Vr4

3) Then post these 2 tweets from his new @linustorvalds account:

- - @yastanimeil Proudly playing #TheGame23 Project #metahack phrack.org/thegame thanks to @player via @m1Vr4
- - Dear followers, please read phrack.com/metahack and follow @yastanimeil & @m1Vr4 to play #TheGame23 You have been infected. Infekt The Others!


#HIVEMIND hacktion $HACKTION #CTF03 #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

i.e. #HIVEMIND send a flower bouquet to @person at $LOCATION #CTF03 #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4


At any moment during #TheGame23 you can get HELP by querying #HIVEMIND like this:

Hi #HIVEMIND I need #HELP. Any player knows howto $data to successfully complete #CTF03? #TheGame23

i.e.:
Hi #HIVEMIND I need #HELP. Any player knows howto find @person's physical address to successfully complete #CTF03? #TheGame23

If $HACKTION is successfully completed, points will be awarded to both @player and @helper

On completion of a certain $HACKTION the @player will post:

Hi @yastanimeil I successfully completed $HACKTION #CTF03 #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

If you have been helped to complete your $HACKTION you will post:

Hi @yastanimeil I successfully completed $HACKTION @helper1 and @helper2 made me do it #CTF03 #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4


Another way to query #HIVEMIND is to access a command syntax.

i.e. Hi #HIVEMIND I need #HELP on $COMMAND Thanks /b/ros! via @m1Vr4

Other @players will then proceed to help this fellow /b/ro and issue the required info on that command.

i.e.
Hi #HIVEMIND I need #HELP on #PLAYERCOUNT Thanks /b/ros! via @m1Vr4

Answer:
Hi @player Welcome to #TheGame23 Your help on #PLAYERCOUNT is ready at pastebin.com/gigMHfXW You are welcome!


Another way to query #HIVEMIND is to ask for ANY kind of information on ANYTHING by creating a personal hashtag:

like this:
Hi #HIVEMIND I need #HELP on #SQLInjection Thanks /b/ros! via @m1Vr4

Other @players monitoring #HELP would then help /s/he like this:

@player Hi /b/ro! Regarding #SQLInjection get this book: AFD937408D1BF13DE5F21F4EB32A8ED614F348D2 via @m1Vr4


Sometimes $HACKTIONS are awarded with points. Some others points cannot be awarded, for there might be
no way to track @players hacktions. In this last case it is said that $HACKTION is done #4dalulz

@players can issue a #protip to #HIVEMIND once they have successfully decoded
an item to complete a $HACKTION or #CTF

like this:

Hi #HIVEMIND I got a #protip for you: $PROTIP #CTF04 #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

i.e.
Hi #HIVEMIND I got a #protip for you: DNS at site.com is vulnerable to CVE-2001-0010 #CTF04 #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

Again, if you need more than 140 chars to explain it, you can substitute $PROTIP for a pastebin link.

Sometimes @yastanimeil CENTCOM will award a certain @player points for an interesting #protip like this:

Congrats @player! Your lulz/imagination/skillz won you 1337 points! #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4



You can suggest $HACKTIONS to @yastanimeil CENTCOM like this:

Hi @yastanimeil I suggest $HACKTION for #HIVEMIND #justsaying #TheGame23

Then other members of #HIVEMIND monitoring #justsaying #TheGame23 will
upvote it by retwitting @player's suggestion

If @yastanimeil CENTCOM considers that the suggested $HACKTION has been retweeted by many @players
and is powerful in either #lulz or imagination or skills, the task will be submitted to
#HIVEMIND like this:

Hi #HIVEMIND @player suggests $HACKTION #CTF04 SHALL WE PLAY #TheGame23? phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

If @player requires more than 140 chars to explain $HACKTION he can substitute $HACKTION for a pastebin link.
Please feel free to use TOR to connect to pastebin.com if you deem it necessary.

@yastanimeil CENTCOM will award certain points to @players for reasons given in due time.

#CENTCOM awards @player 1337 points for $REASON congrats! #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

If a @player develops a $HACKTION so intense, imaginative and creative that it goes massively viral
on the interwebz s/he will be awarded the great sum of 13337 points and a mention in the #HALLOFFAME

Certain $HACKTIONs are described with an alias, such as audit:

#HIVEMIND audit site.com #CTF01 Project #metahack via @m1Vr4
definition:
audit. ambiguous. for some @players audit = PWN. for some others audit = protect.

If you decide that you are going to PWN site.com, please do it with aesthetics & style:
don't just deface it: be atent to details and please make sure the #lulz are high in glee.
If you need to increment the #lulz of the #HIVEMIND by sharing your plunder, please feel free
to bittorrent the hell out of it and post the link or magnet hash.

If successful please post the following:

Hi @yastanimeil #GLEEALERT! I have increased the #lulz in the #HIVEMIND site.com is #TANGODOWN & #PWNED
#4dalulz #CTF01 #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via m1Vr4

#HIVEMIND bittorrent $item #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

Self explanatory.

i.e.

#HIVEMIND bittorrent 8432221589 #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

@player will then:

0. Create a username at thepiratebay.se that matches @player's name at Tweeter
1. Upload bittorrent to thepiratebay.se/torrent/
2. Inform Mr. Google of its location: google.com/addurl

Once successful, @player will post the following:

@yastanimeil Delivered: $MAGNETHASH #4dalulz and for #HIVEMIND with lots of love phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

i.e.
@yastanimeil Delivered: E24622CBC2803C22D1991FB0EB31CFE1B4AB9679 #4dalulz phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

137 points will be awarded to the quickest person to upload and report $item

technical details:
book = PDF always prefered. epub also accepted.
mp3 = 320 kbps encoded with LAME ffs!
Please refer to:
wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=LAME#Maximum_quality_and_archiving
mkv/mp4 = use handbrake.fr/downloads.php default settings

In this case, googling 8432221589 resolves to this book:

Abaddon el exterminador (The Angel of Darkness) by Ernesto Sabato

User communication:
#HIVEMIND send @user $message $counter times #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

i.e.
#HIVEMIND send @BillGates "SHALL WE PLAY A GAME? Please read phrack.com/metahack and play with us!"
1 time #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

Each @player in the #HIVEMIND will then proceed to send @BillGates this message, just ONCE:

@BillGates SHALL WE PLAY A GAME? Please read phrack.com/metahack and play with us! via @m1Vr4

#HIVEMIND DDoS @luser with love $counter times #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

This command instructs #HIVEMIND to send @luser a certain amount of messages.

i.e.
#HIVEMIND DDoS @EsperanzAguirre with love 3 times #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

@player will then proceed to send @luser loads of love 3 times:

i.e.
Dear @EsperanzAguirre Yo mama so hairy, she has afros on her nipples
#4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

The best aka most #LULZYPHER/imaginative/skillful messages, once spotted by @yastanimeil CENTCOM or once
they have been retweeted enough times by #HIVEMIND will win 13 points for each message sent.
i.e. if @yastanimeil issued a command to send love 3 times, if chosen, @player would get 39 points.

#HIVEMIND d0x @luser #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

where d0x means to extract as much information as possible on @luser by using ANY means suitable.

@player will then proceed to google @luser (or use ANY other means to extract info about @luser)
and document his findings at titanpad.com

Once successful, s/he will then post his findings like this:

@yastanimeil Delivered: titanpad.com/ZbIT5Mc #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

Successful d0x will be awarded certain points depending on the quality AND the amount of lulz injected
into #HIVEMIND

Other times @players can act on their own in a *CREATIVE* and imaginative way. You can then
notify @yastanimeil CENTCOM like this:

i.e.
Hi @yastanimeil I have #CREATED this wonderful video for the #HIVEMIND with love youtube.com/video #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

@yastanimeil CENTCOM particularly like these CREATIVE actions.
Points will be awarded considering the lulz/imagination/skillz involved.

If your $HACKTION is high in #lulz and glee, please specify so: #4dalulz
i.e.

Hi @yastanimeil I have run with my naked ass at the Superbowl #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4
Hi @yastanimeil I have french kissed @marianorajoy on national TV #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

These high profile $HACKTIONS with high potential for #lulz and glee for the #HIVEMIND might be awarded
with an inclusion in #TheGame23 #HallofFame.

Hi @player Your wonderful work of love at site.com/workoflove wins you $POINTS #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

You can share some #TOOLSOFTHETRADE with #HIVEMIND like this:

@yastanimeil #TOOLSOFTHETRADE Hi #HIVEMIND I have created a github repository at github.com/metahack
to work together to port The #Cathedral to Ruby #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

If @player spots #metahack #TheGame23 on the media, s/he will post:

#MEDIAALERT! #metahack #TheGame23 has been featured in news.com/metahack GOGOGO!!! #HIVEMIND phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4


where read means to profusely read a certain article/book/txt/pastebin and to comment means to
create a metahack.wikia.com entry on the subject with #HIVEMIND pieces of wisdom on the subject.

Every now and then, @yastanimeil CENTCOM will monitor metahack.wikia.com for interesting submissions
where the #lulz/#imagination/#skillz are high and award the corresponding points to @player
Please make sure that your username at wikia.com matches your @player name at twitter.

where write usually means to spray a graffiti and $LOCATION is given in Google Coordinates

Sometimes a certain user can be instructed to commit a certain task.

i.e. @banksy write $WHATEVER at $LOCATION #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

Once successful, @player will report @yastanimeil CENTCOM back:


#HIVEMIND storm $PLACE #4dalulz #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

where storm means to MASSIVELY inject #lulz at $PLACE

i.e. #HIVEMIND storm 4chan.com/b #4dalulz

@players will report back to @yastanimeil CENTCOM like this:

#HIVEMIND storming 4chan.com/b in progress at boards.4chan.org/b/thread/571305783 #4dalulz via @m1Vr4

@yastanimeil CENTCOM can set temporary variables into #HIVEMIND

i.e.
#HIVEMIND set $variable = value #TheGame23 phrack.com/metahack via @m1Vr4

for instance, these aliases come hardcoded into #HIVEMIND:

4chan.com/b = /b/
nsa.gov = ass

Programming #TheGame23 #HIVEMIND

No game would be a good game provided you couldn't reverse engineer and re-program it, right?
It's the same with #metahack #TheGame23, of course!

To program #HIVEMIND these commands are useful.

First, @player has to enter c0de mode:

i.e.
#HIVEMIND c0de $WHATEVER

#TheGame23 Programming language is called #LULZYPHER
There is a Programmer's Reference at lulzy.wikia.com or wherever #HIVEMIND decides to setup a wiki on it.
As with any other language, there are unknown or undocumented commands, of course. #LULZYPHER is no less.

A quick cheatsheet on #TheGame23 c0de mode:

#HIVEMIND c0de $variable = value #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

i.e.
#HIVEMIND c0de whitehouse.gov = mydick #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

Incidentaly, it is noted that that is a useful technique to bypass legal firewalls,
for then @player could safely inject the following command into #HIVEMIND

i.e.
#HIVEMIND audit mydick #TheGame23 phrack.org/thegame via @m1Vr4

Obviously, the result of these commands is dependent upon successful retwitting from
#TheGame23 community. If @player is #LULZYPHER/imaginative/skillful in his #LULZYPHER c0ding abilities
s/he will be recognized by #HIVEMIND and $HACKTIONS will be performed.
Otherwise, it's a matter of not giving up. You don't learn LISP, SCALA, ERLANG, HASKELL or ASM in one day.
It's the same with #LULZYPHER: the best way to learn #LULZYPHER is by doing.
It's a matter of *imagination*, *creativity*, trial and err, wash, rinse, repeat.

Also, if your c0de becomes close to poetry (poetry = the highest form of c0de, of course) and
@yastanimeil CENTCOM spots it, s/he might decide to retweet it for the glee of #HIVEMIND,
in which case $HACKTION would become law for #HIVEMIND Congrats!




- From time to time @yastanimeil CENTCOM will issue the following command:

Dear followers, if you want glee please read phrack.org/thegame and then follow
@m1Vr4 & @yastanimeil to play #TheGame23 #4dalulz with us!

Don't just retwit it: you HAVE to post the tweet on your own timeline.


HAL9001

#HANDOVER #HIVEMIND CENTCOM to @newcentcom for $TIME #4dalulz GOGOGO! #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

Every now and then @yastanimeil will submit control of #HIVEMIND to a particular user that
has shown a proficiency of the #LULZYPHER language AND/OR whose #HACKTIONS have been particularly brave in #lulz.
This command allows @newcentcom to issue commands to the #HIVEMIND for a certain amount of time.

All @players in #TheGame23 are then subjected to whatever crazy orders @newcentcom issues.
Points will be awarded to CTFs and $HACKTIONS proposed, as usual.

i.e.
#HANDOVER #HIVEMIND CENTCOM to @JohnCleese for 5 minutes #4dalulz GOGOGO! #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

@yastanimeil CENTCOM will then enter ECHO mode and will retweet each tweet that @JohnCleese posts, for 5 minutes

#HIVEMIND #FLASHMOB $LOCATION at $TIME with $HACKTION #4dalulz via @m1Vr4

i.e.
#HIVEMIND #FLASHMOB your local municipality next 12/31/2014 at 12:00am UTC
timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20141231T00&p0=3758&msg=%23FLASHMOB&csz=1&swk=1
with youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY #4dalulz via @m1Vr4


#HIVEMIND go #PLAYERCOUNT via @m1Vr4

This is a powerful command. It instructs logged on, online and active @players to show current status.

@yastanimeil Agent @player reporting from $LOCATION Ready to enter #HACKTION via @m1Vr4

where $LOCATION can be as general as "Paris, France" or as particular as you want to make it known.
You can also post $LOCATION as #STEALTH, of course.

This way you can monitor the #PLAYERCOUNT hashtag and spot fellow Agents close to you to maybe conspire
together #4dalulz Please make sure that you follow each other to be able to send Direct Messages each other.

This command can be accompanied by a $TARGET like this:

#HIVEMIND go #PLAYERCOUNT at $TARGET via @m1Vr4

i.e. #HIVEMIND go #PLAYERCOUNT at /b/ via @m1Vr4

@players would then:

1 - Open a thread at 4chan.org/b/
2 - Report to #HIVEMIND thread location

#HIVEMIND thread ready at boards.4chan.org/b/thread/571339042 GOGOGO!!! #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4

#HIVEMIND will then retweet the first thread reported so that others can join the party #4dalulz

3 - Post this at /b/ thread:

Agent @player reporting from $LOCATION Ready to enter #HACKTION phrack.org/thegame #TheGame23 via @m1Vr4



A variation of this command is issued by CENTCOM when it is useful to find how many agents populate aCKt
particular area.

i.e. #HIVEMIND go #PLAYERCOUNT if you are in New York City via @m1Vr4

@player will then report like this:

@yastanimeil Agent @player reporting from New York City Ready to enter #HACKTION via @m1Vr4




Every now and then @yastanimeil will post a PGP-signed auth pastebin to prove that the account is still controlled
by the official #HIVEMIND CENTCOM at @yastanimeil If you suspect that the account might have been hijacked, DEMAND that
a PGP-signed auth pastebin be posted.


#TheCathedral

What is #TheCathedral

#TheCathedral is #TheGame23 supreme goal:
to build a Cathedral with the help of the #HIVEMIND once the number
of @players (=followers of @m1Vr4) of #TheGame23 has passed the 10.800.000 mark.

@alejodorowsky and @arrabalf are #TheCathedral .: Master Stonemasons :.

Not much can be said of this super-sekrit Project yet, but this:
#TheCathedral is *GUARANTEED* to be a plunder of #lulz

Moar #lulz will be explained in due time.

Rodrigo has suffered living with @m1Vr4
more than any other 1337hax0r alive.
He who has suffered you, KNOWS YOU.
Hence Rodrigo knows @m1Vr4 A LOT.
Rodrigo bought a ticket to @m1Vr4 to see
Eric Clapton at the @RoyalAlbertHall
in London, UK once @m1Vr4 managed to get
his first job as a do-it-all at wanstor.com
Incidentaly Peter Lukes, it was a joy
to work there and I always appreciated how
you treated me, even though I blew it
big time. I couldn't stand doing support
calls about internet connections, you must
understand that, when I was so EAGER to
learn everything about the trade. Please
send regards to Ferdie and the rest of
the guys over there. Please send also
my warmest regards to your wife, whom
it was also a pleasure to work with.
Conductin audits with her allowed me to
realize firsthand how fucked up pharmaceutical
companies are.
Back to Eric Clapton tickets: unfortunately,
our seats where a fucking shit!!!
hence we did what any other spaniard con
dos cojones would have done: suddenly jump
all over the velvet theater seats and
move several rows forward.
Con dos cojones #4dalulz
Rodrigo, whose intelligence and big heart
@m1Vr4 had always admired once told @m1Vr4
the following: @m1Vr4, you are SUPERSMART.
Yes, SUPERSMART, I remember it precisely.
@m1Vr4, who always thought that Rodrigo
was highly gifted, cried out loud in tears
in front of him: for it was true, but
@m1Vr4 had never thought of him that way.
His self-steem was so low...
In fact, @m1Vr4 thought he was a little
stupid, for he tried hard to earn a
degree at University but he couldn't,
and he wasn't even able to finish a
2 years course on F.P. System Administration
for he had just discovered internet and he
spent days and nights reading phrack.com
downloaded through a 2400 bauds modem
in absolute shock at the things that damn
route/daemon9 was able to do. He also
looked up on @dotMudge so so so much.
@m1Vr4 knew FOR SURE that he would never
EVER become not even a 100th skilled, no
matter how many years @m1Vr4 spent
reading and trying exploits.
Even though @m1Vr4 made his way through
several high profile supercomputers at
places such as @CESGA_ @unican ciemat.es
or cines.fr or even hacked his way into
a nuclear aircraft supercarrier at navy.mil
amongst the more than  100.000 cleartext
passwords that he managed to loot,
he *ALWAYS* thought of himself as nothing
more than a fucking skiddie.

@m1Vr4 also
used to spend HOURS idling at !H hoping
some pieces of wisdom thrown at him by
a certain jfs or another certain Zhodiac
penetrated his hard stupid head.

Rodrigo, hijoputa, al final creaste
una empresa de seguridad y seguro que
encima de pasártelo teta te estarás
hinchando a ganar pasta gansa, cabrón!!

Siempre supe que eras un puto crack
y que podrías sacar adelante cualquier
cosa que te propusieras.

Me siento orgulloso de ti, tío.

Rodrigo, lo siento si la cagué con
todos vosotros.
Estaba atravesando un mal momento y
los hongos no me sentaron muy bien al ego.
Diles a todos que les quiero y que
fue un jodidísimo placer quemarlas como
las quemamos!! Aunque Juanito terminara
siempre bebiéndose hasta el agua de los floreros
y filosofando conmigo sobre nosequéhostias de
que si yo había "cruzado la puerta"... #WTF!

Por cierto Juanito, eres buena persona como
tú solito, pero capullo, comprende que ya
estaba hasta el chichi de que te apalancaras
en el salón de casa durante semanas ad infinitum...
Ya me explicarás algún día que coño era eso
de "cruzar la puerta", mamonazo. :-*

Rodrigo:

Por todo lo que hiciste por
mí (incluido el presentarme a Jessica y a Katia...)
de todo corazón: GRACIAS.

P.D. Dile a Zalo que no se lo perdono: se portó como
un cabrón no dándome el teléfono de la argentina
del Sandeman Allen House!! #tenamigosparaeso

from the seriousness of life and restoring him to an unexpected
boyishness. The symbol of art is seen again in the magic flute of
the Great God PAN which makes the young goats frisk at the edge

in a way great when it is interpreted as an attempt to instill
youthfulness into an ancient world."

You. You. You are alive.

and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees

and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again

and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream

and the universe said I love you

and the universe said you have played the game well

and the universe said everything you need is within you

and the universe said you are stronger than you know

and the universe said you are the daylight

and the universe said you are the night

and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you

and the universe said the light you seek is within you

and the universe said you are not alone

and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing

and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code

and the universe said I love you because you are love.

And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.

You are the player.

Wake up.

#protip: in the absence of @yastanimeil or @m1Vr4, @players with the most followers can c0de #HIVEMIND
and create #CTF's challenges. They can take their own iniciative by proposing #HACKTIONS that
stimulate the glee in the #HIVEMIND: #lulz, #imagination, #skillz

#SURPRISE

#HIVEMIND send #SUPRISE to @player #STEALTH on behalf of @player2

where #SURPRISE is something that @player REALLY values, no matter how much is it money wise (for,
as you will probably have realised by now, the donations coming from the #Philanthropist will save this
world and help run #TheGame23 forward. For some people, it could be a pair of scissors that belonged
to his mum when she was still alive. For other people it might be a Lamborghini Miura, for they had
*really* *really* dreamts about it in the past...

Something that by receiving it /s/he would cry.

Obviously it is hard to surprise someone when everybody is monitoring #HIVEMIND's #HACKTIONS
In that case, use the hashtag #STEALTH to know that you have to coordinate yourselves in sekrit c0de.

i.e. in case it was @m1Vr4 the one to #SURPRISE it would be more than enough with these $items:

#THISISAROBBERY!!!!!!!!

PUMPKIN (yelling to all): Everybody be cool THIS IS A ROBBERY!!!
HONEY BUNNY: Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute
every one of you motherfuckers!!!

In order to accomplish this #HACKTION you have to organize and coordinate yourselves in teams.

i.e. #TEAMpurchasers - they will coordinate with @EFF to receive the funds needed in order to
purchase the goods required to satisfy @player's needs.
#TEAMinvestigators - they will coordinate with @player's family and close friends in #STEALTH mode
in order to find out what that @player *REALLY* values in life, no matter how costly or cheap it be.
#TEAMdeliverers will coordinate to suprise @player in the most beautiful and heartbreaking way.
etc. etc...

#IWILLTOBESTOW and #DESEODAR commands:

i.e.

or
Hola #HIVEMIND Soy Amancio Ortega Gaona, Chairman of @inditexgroup #IMWORTH $60.7 bill #DESEODAR 100.000.000 euros a @EFF apoyando #TheGame23
or
Hola #HIVEMIND Soy Carlos Slim Helu @carlosslim #IMWORTH $82.2 bill #DESEODAR 100.000$ a @EFF apoyando #TheGame23
Hi #HIVEMIND I'm Larry Ellison @larryellison #IMWORTH $49.3 bill #IWILLTOBESTOW: $49 bill to @EFF in support of #TheGame23

Please see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World's_Billionaires
and forbes.com/billionaires/ for further info.


#LIFEISABOXOFCHOCOLATES

This command delivers to $person a box of chocolates. Not just any box of chocolates, of course.
This has to be researched *THOROUGHLY* in order to find out the *ABSOLUTELY BEST, MOST EXPENSIVE and
MOST LUXURIOUS* box of chocolates that money can buy on this planet *AND* it will packaged with all
care, mime and love paired with the absolutely fucking *BEST* #POCKETWATCH that money can buy.

Once #LIFEISABOXOFCHOCOLATES +#POCKETWATCH have been successfully found they will *HAVE* (NO EXCUSES)
to be delivered by @player or by a team of @players to @person's $LOCATION, obviously bypassing his personal
security measures, no matter how hard they are. We have the best 1337 #REDTEAM in the planet to
successfully bypass *ANY* security measure so that our #skillz would put James Bond 007 to total shame, right?
Then fucking PROVE IT!

QUICKHOWTO bypass *ANY* security measure:
#protip: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery

please enjoy the #lulz

These following commands come hardc0ded within the #HIVEMIND Kernel. This means that they *HAVE*
to be accomplished no matter how hard they look like. Obviously I propose that:

1- The fucking BEST Worldwide #REDTEAM on this planet has to be created and properly hierarchized

HOWTO hierarchize *ANY* human group.

Easy.

By asking each @player WHO are the @players that /s/he admires the most and that /s/he considers
that are better than him at the selected #HACKTION

In order to do this, an #ALGORITHM has to be invented in order to sort out @players in #TheGame23 by #KARMA
aka h-index (human-index) aka en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index

That is:
for a certain #TASK, a @player can have an h-index of, say, 100 (maximum). This perfect score would mean
that ALL @players within that #TASK's expertise would agree that this @player is the FUCKING BEST person
to leader a particular #TASK

i.e. in the field of theoretical physicist everybody agrees that Edward Witten is the most respected
@player in the world.

Hence his #KARMA would have the ability to influence the #HIVEMIND decisions in matters of #theoreticalphysics
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay moar than @m1Vr4's opinions on the subject might account.

In other words, Mr. Witten's 100 #KARMA on #theoreticalphysics would HEAVYLY influence #HIVEMIND so
that /s/he could issue commands to #HIVEMIND with instructions on a certain #TASK

i.e. #HIVEMIND I recruit @Prof_S_Hawking to assist me in #TASK

#HIVEMIND would then kindly approach Mr. Hawking and inform him about #TheGame23 and his role in it.

So, back to our #READTEAM...:

#HIVEMIND I recruit Mr. @Bruce_Schneier and Mr. @mike_schiffman as Heads of #READTEAM

A Head of #ANYTHING principal mission is to COORDINATE the recruiting of the absolute *BEST* people
in the business. World. Wide.

If a required @person work for obscure employers (read #NSA, #MI6, #MOSSAD, #FBI, #PENTAGON, #DARPA,
etc. etc.) and #REDTEAM *requires* them to join #REDTEAM then, it is extremely simple...:

#protip: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery from #EFFIMF (@EFF's International Monetary Fund)


So...

#HIVEMIND c0de #ALGORITHM for #KARMADB #PRIORITY2 Head of #ALGORITHM is Donald Knuth
#HIVEMIND run #KARMADB on #HUMANITY to hierarchize ALL human knowledge. #PRIORITY3
#HIVEMIND Head of #KARMADB is @montywi @larryellison Sergei Brin & Larry Page

For this reason, #CTF007 = #PROTECTKILLSWITCH becomes #HIVEMIND #PRIORITY1 #TASK
A #PRIORITY1 #TASK means that ***ALL*** resources available to the #HIVEMIND will be reallocated

  _______________________  This picture belongs to Sara.  The circumstances by
 /¤.....................¤\ which she acquired the picture are rather fuzzy and
 |........__ . __........| most people had learned not to ask about it.  It
 |......./ *\./* \.......| wasn't that Sara was afraid of divulging the origin
 |.......| \/.\/ |.......| of her favorite painting ever, the story just
 |.......| |...| |.......| happened to be long and boring.  Most people didn't
 |....../  \---/  \......| want to KNOW where she got the painting, they just
 |.../\/__/_\_/_\__\/\...| wanted to know who painted it.  They wanted to award
 |...|ö|  \ / \ /  |ö|...| Sara points based on the creator of the painting, so
 |...\/\    * *    /\/...| they might know how much she was worth.  As Sara
 |......| |\/|\/| |......| knew, she wasn't worth very much.  Most people
 |......| |`_^_`| |......| aren't worth anything these days.  It's their
 |......| |.....| |......| output that has value, their creations.  In some
 |.....//|\\.|.//|\\.....| circles, excrement had a higher value than this
 |.....\\v//...\\v//.....| painting, knowledge, or anything else that you and I
 |......"."....."."......| might value more than our own poopie.  But that is
 \¤.....................¤/ not what's important to us at the moment, no reader,
  -----------------------  it is the story of this painting that interests you.

I can tell you aren't the type to award points, because you understand the
points aren't anyone's to reward.  As a result of knowing this, I can't tell
you the name of the painter for doing so might create in you a need to
establish a point system that might see Sara as unfit for our company.  Seeing
how Sara is a very close friend of mine, that won't do.  You see, I've sworn to
protect her in anyway that I can because she is a close friend.  'Round here
that's what close friends do for one another.  We watch over each other and
one another's creations.

    /\
    \ \       /\     This is a picture of me.  It's actually on the reverse of
     \ \     /\ \    the painting Sara holds so near and dear to her.  My name
      \ \   / /\/    is (foo)²  Most of my life has been spent as guardian to
       \ \_/ /       Sara and her painting.  You see I used to be a mere
       /  ¡  \       stuffed bunny until one day, this crazy scientist man
      _{-----}_      decided that in such a crazed world where he could wonder
     / \  ö  / \     around and create things like me, that Sara would need a
    /   \   /   \    protector.  He knew that one day that all the crazies like
   / /|  \_/  |\ \   him would have to be stopped, so in a fit of
  / / |       | \ \  self-fulfilling prophecy and destruction, I was created by
 (88) / /\_/\ \ (88) this mad scientist.
      \ \   / /
  ____ \ \ / / ____  Neither Sara nor I have seen this mad scientist since the
 / __ \/ / \ \/ __ \ day I was created.  Now that I think about it, I had a
 \______/   \______/ life before I was "created" and it bothers me that people

would doubt my existence before a mad scientist touched me with his magical
mad scientist wand.  It's not like mad scientists even possess wands, unless
they are really magic users left over from the long long ago times when you
know, they used to play D&D and got the notion stuck in their head that they
really were magicians.  Alchemy is yesteryear's Chemistry, so who's to say that
mad scientists aren't really mad wizards?  If I was a wizard and immortal at
that, I'd be kinda mad that people didn't believe I was a wizard and instead
called me a scientist.  Some people get really upset about being called
scientists.  Especially wizards.

After much discussion one night, Sara and I concluded that the mad scientist
who created me was in fact a wizard.  However he wasn't a very powerful or good
wizard considering he tried to create me, the stuffed bunny, who at the time
was very well alive and active.  (Again, there is stipulation as to whether or
not a stuffed bunny can be alive and active, but if I wasn't able to, how could
I be telling my story right now?  Yeah, you think it's because of the mad
scientist wizard, don't you?  If some nut case like that could distribute soul
and consciousness at whim, don't you think our world would be a little more
populated?)

    \|/\|/  I found this frog dead at my feet.  I was supposed to meet him
    //  \\  for a drink late at night a few months ago.  We were planning to
   // __ \\ talk about the existence of wizards as modern day mad scientists.
   \\/  \// Sara was sick at home, so after I tended to her I went to meet
    \____/  this frog at a location previously arranged through secure lines of

communication.  Divulging that information would be like telling you who made
Sara's favorite picture, it's not a piece of information you as an intelligent
reader care about at all, thus it is not important.  Do not allow yourself to
be distracted by the details, rather admire the creation for what it is.  After
all, if you really cared about the details of the painting you'd already know
that it cost my friend the frog his life.

At this point in time, it's hard to say if a mad scientist was involved or not.
It might've been YOU!  YES YOU READER!  YOU ARE TRYING TO MESS UP MY STORY BY
KILLING ONE OF THE CHARACTERS BEFORE HE'S INTRODUCED BECAUSE YOU'RE MAD THAT
I WON'T TELL YOU WHO PAINTED THAT PICTURE THAT SARA LOVES SO MUCH!  YOU KIDS
AND YOUR INTERACTION!  ALWAYS GETTING INVOLVED, DOING YOUR PART TO HELP OUT
ALRIGHT!  WELL I TELL YOU WHAT...

All I know is that I'm not taking any chances next time I see someone with a
wand.  Mad scientists are a force not to be reckoned with, whether they be
wizards or not.

(enough?)

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that:

"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; THIS RIGHT
INCLUDES FREEDOM TO HOLD OPINIONS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND TO SEEK,
RECEIVE AND IMPART INFORMATION AND IDEAS THROUGH ANY MEDIA AND
REGARDLESS OF FRONTIERS."

Today freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognized in
international and regional human rights law. The right is enshrined in
Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 13 of the
American Convention on Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter
on Human and Peoples' Rights. Based on John Milton's arguments,
freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes
not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas,
but three further distinct aspects:

THE RIGHT TO SEEK INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****;
THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****;
THE RIGHT TO IMPART INFORMATION AND ***** IDEAS *****.

International, regional and national standards also recognize that
freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, be
it orally, in written, in print, THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THROUGH ART
FORMS.

THIS MEANS THAT THE PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AS A RIGHT
INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE CONTENT, BUT ALSO THE MEANS OF EXPRESSION.

Rabbit as Symbol: The Significance of Rabbits in Dreams and Art, by Sandy Koi.

"One of the most important archetypes is that of the Psychopomp. A Psychopomp is a god or goddess (energy form) that
acts as a liaison, and guide, between the three worlds-the physical earthly level that we dwell upon, the Underworld and
the Heavens. In classical mythology, the Roman God Mercury was a Psychopomp, for example.

HE GUIDED THE ANCIENT HEROES TO AND THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD,
AND HE ALSO BROUGHT MESSAGES FROM ABOVE TO THE MERE MORTALS HERE ON EARTH.

Symbolically, Rabbit in the Underworld is therefore representative of USING ONE'S INTUITION: knowing how to get around
"in the dark" and being comfortable traveling in "unmarked territory." By default, it can also denote having or
DEVELOPING TRUST IN THE "INNER LIGHT."

RABBIT DOES NOT NEED AN OUTSIDE SOURCE TO ILLUMINATE HIS WAY.

His connection to the Collective Energy maintains his pathway.

They teach us Unconditional Love, and Compassion for Life, by virtue of eliciting those things within us.

And one important symbolical meaning that Rabbit should elicit in us is that of PLAYFULNESS AND JOY.
Their nonsense displays of happiness are part of the Dance of Life-which is nothing more than a Cosmic Binkie."

IIIIth ENIGMA question:

What is the ♥ of The Crown?

Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was a Swedish philosopher and scientist
who, at 56, had a spiritual awakening and wrote numerous books on his
theological views and related topics. He advocated a version of
Christianity where works count as much as faith, with the trinity
existing in Jesus, instead of three separate entities. Swedenborg
derived inspiration from dreams and visions, and claimed to be able to
visit heaven and hell at will. His works were widely read after his
death and highly regarded by poets, writers and mystics such as Blake,
Baudelaire, Strindberg, Balzac, Yeats, Jung, and William James.

The following electronic texts have been converted automatically for
sacred-texts by a volunteer. Swedenborg's writings are indexed by
paragraph number. Each of the texts have been arbitrarily separated into
50-paragraph files:

- - - - - --------[ 2.- WikiLeaks and Julian Assange in great danger


At the time of writing this (June 15, 2010), WikiLeaks Founder Julian
Assange is being hunted by Pentagon over a possibly massive 260.000
diplomatic cables leak, after ex-'hacker' Adrian Lamo turned the
supposed whistleblower to the FBI and ex-'hacker' Kevin Poulsen broke the
very 1st rule of journalism on Wired by revealing his name.

Daniel Ellsberg, who gained fame when he leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971
in hopes of ending the Vietnam War, told MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan that he not
only sees a parallel between himself and the person who recently leaked a
video of an assault by US forces on Iraqi civilians but also fears for the
safety of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who published the video.

“What if WikiLeaks was a sort of Wiki-BitTorrent, served by thousands of
people around the world running a background process on their computers,”
mused  Edward Benson, a Ph.D. student at the MIT Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

“No fundraising needed here, it’s all P2P. And if the Wiki is maintained
Wikipedia style, then we no longer need to pay for a centralized staff to
curate it. Plus, there’s no centralized staff to kill or jail. It can be a
decentralized, collaborative process.”

WikiLeaks has started to serve Magnet links, yet the role of the Editor
(Julian) is maintained in order to supervise and to assign priorities
to what is leaked and what is not.

Unfortunately, this puts the role of the Editor in great personal danger
and in risk of being 'totally incapacitated' —CIA's term to refer to Daniel
Ellsberg— by potential enemies while it dramatically slows down the
release process.

By its own nature, WikiLeaks mirror servers are limited in numbers, and
very much resource-hungry during media peaks.

Being limited in numbers means that they are prone to attack, DDoS,
international IP bans, governmental inclusion in blacklists... etc. etc.
These are single point of failure that threaten the infrastructure of the
whole system.


Project Mayhem 2012 aims to circumvent these issues.

Project Mayhem 2012 turns into a real uncensorable Superorganism that
predates the net:

an uncensorable civil cipherspace ontop the cyberspace.

In other words, we would like to help Mr. Obama to fulfill his promises
and to make them extensible to the whole of society. World. Wide.

____________________________________________________________________

Protect Whistleblowers:

"Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in
government is an existing government employee committed to public
integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism,
which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should
be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees
as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama
will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose
waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure
that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower
claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process."

>:PROJECT MAYHEM 2012


Time has come to encourage COURAGE and to issue a CALL TO HACKZION
for PROJECT MAYHEM 2012.


Project Mayhem 2012 is a Mutant Egregor Reality-Hacking Wargame.

Reality Hacking is any phenomenon which EMERGES from the nonviolent use of
legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially or
culturally subversive ends.

An Egregor (also "Egregore") is an occult concept representing a
"thoughtform" or "collective group mind", an autonomous psychic entity made
up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people. The symbiotic
relationship between an Egregor and its group has been compared to the more
recent, non-occult concepts of the CORPORATION (AS A LEGAL ENTITY) and the
meme.

No 'perfectly ideal' p2p darknet design is going to be explained here.

Instead, we are going to do something WAY BETTER:

Project Mayhem 2012 is a [Metaheuristically/Hyper-heuristic] self-
actualizing self-repairable IDEAS GENERATOR:

TYLER, its 'problem child', paraphrasing Albert Hoffman.


Project Mayhem 2012 is a passionated Swarm Intelligence Egregor,
iMAGInaCKtive, ants/locusts/bees-colony alike, hard workingly playful,
creative, Groucho Marxist, joy free and quasi-fnord free, fully open to
friends and foes, transparent, independent, non-profit, apolitical but
chaotically fnOrdered while dynamically Sampo-Adhocratic, non-violent
though more than 'strike hard' capable, autonomous, self-sustained and
sharing community to brainstorm ideas and coordinate volunteers everywhere
in the development of TYLER.

Project Mayhem 2012 will be the biggest HACKARTISTIC joint challenge ever
for the very top hacktivists, coders, cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks and
non-violent Civil Rights, Internet Censorship and Freedom of Speech
activists everywhere to collaborate to jointly BRAINSTORM IDEAS and to
develop TYLER.

To avoid stalling, we won't aim at 'perfection': errors happen...
Everything is OK!

Any big problem is only a META-PROBLEM: a problem about solving problems:
a microcosm SPIRAL that mimics the growth of a Macrocosmic SPIRAL.

'Almost good enough' might be MORE than a 'good enough' mentality.
Less Syntactics, More Semantics.

Nobody knows everything that is known, but all together, we know it ALL.

'Evolutionary Computing', 'Adaptative Thinking', 'Dynamically Adhocratic'
and 'Mutating problem solving' are key elements here.

We don't aim to find the 'best' solution, as there might be infinite ways
to achieve a single goal: we aim to MOVE UPWARDS the spiral.

Or, in Herman Hesse's words:

"We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still much to learn. We are
not going around in circles, we are moving UP, the circle is a SPIRAL, we
have already ascended many a level."


Obviously Project Mayhem 2012 will ALWAYS respect the Law:

we don't fight against ANYTHING: we will simply ADAPT around it,
and then make it CHANGE to fit our Swarm Intelligence NEEDS of Peace,
Justice, Freedom, Beauty and Truth.

Project Mayhem 2012 is a Worldwide GrouchoMarxist Re-Evolution Party
celebration of Freedom.

Party not as in as in ['Black vs. White'/'Red vs. Gold'] but as in
'DOING IT 4 TEH LULZ'.

"There's nothing more dangerous than sometone who wants to make the world a
better place.
If you want to say something and have people listen then you have to wear
a MASK.
If you want to be HONEST then you have to live a LIE.
I like to think I have the guts to stand up anonymously in a western
democracy and call for things no-one else believes in - like Peace and
Justice and Freedom."

Project Mayhem 2012 is a 'poeTic ERRORIST' invisible yet very palpable
anti-anti-non-Corporation-but-MAYBE-Not:

we are all errorisTs
errare humanum est

 1. ERRORISM: Concept and action are based on the idea that "error" is
 reality's principle of order.

 2. ERRORISM is a philosophically erroneous position, a ritual of negation,
 a disorganized organization: failure as perfection, error as appropriate
 move.

 3. The field of action of ERRORISM contains all those practices that aim
 at the LIBERATION of the human being and language.

 4. CONFUSION and SURPRISE, black humour and ABSURDITY are the favorite
 tools of the errorists.

 5. Lapses and failed acts are an ERRORIST delight.

"The poeTic ERRORIST behaves like a confidence-TRICKSTER whose aim is not
money but CHANGE.

The medieval Assassins founded a "State" which consisted of a network of
remote mountain valleys and castles, separated by thousands of miles,
strategically invulnerable to invasion, connected by the information flow
of secret agents, at war with all governments, and devoted only to
KNOWLEDGE.

Where our KNOWLEDGE of BEAUTY harmonizes with the Ludus Naturae,

                       *** SORCERY BEGINS ***

No, not spoon-bending or horoscopy, not the Golden Dawn or make-believe
shamanism, astral projection or the Satanic Mass --if it's mumbo jumbo you
want, go for the real stuff, banking, politics, social science-- not that
weak blavatskian crap."
Hakim Bey. Pirate Utopias. T.A.Z.: The Temporary Autonomous Zone.

We are EVERYWHERE.
The fucking Illuminati is US!
We guard you while you sleep.
SO DO NOT FUCK WITH US.




- - - - - --------[ 3.2 - TYLER. 'Ordo ab KOH.' Use soap.


Narrator: What are we doing tonight?
Tyler Durden: Tonight? We make soap.

— 'Ordo ab KOH.'

The saponification of fats with KOH is used to prepare the corresponding
"potassium SOAPS," which are softer than the more common sodium
hydroxide-derived soaps. Because of their softness and greater solubility,
potassium soaps require less water to liquefy, and can thus contain
MORE CLEANING AGENT than liquefied sodium soaps.


TYLER is a massively distributed and decentralized Wikipedia-style P2P
cipherspace structure impregnable to censorship.

TYLER will avoid single point of failures by implementing a distributed
and crowdsourced karma-based TRUST 'Authority' in order to prioritize leaks
relevance and visibility while minimizing information poisoning.
This solution successfully solves the single point of failure inherent to
the role of an Editor.

TYLER will gather an unprecedented number of the best hackers and coders
ever to develop its structure from scratch, from the lessons learned from
the Freenet, TOR, GNUnet, eMule, BitTorrent, I2P, Tribler and related
projects.

TYLER will end its betatesting phase the 5th of noVember, 2012.
TYLER will go wild on the net on 12-12-2012, massively flashmob style.

Machines are usually hacked via 'interlink bugs'.
Humans are usually hacked via 'limbic system bugs'.
This date has been purposely chosen to PLAY with the 2012 meme.
As everybody knows, it's OBVIOUS that prophecies & MagicK do **NOT** exist:

The best way to predict the future is to CREATE IT.

On the 10 days that go from 12-12-2012 to 12-21-2012, the World will see an
unprecedented amount of Corporate, Financial, Military and State leaks that
will have been secretly gathered by millions of CONSCIENTIOUS citizens, vigilants,
whistleblowers and insiders worldwide, dormant cells of a global
'Fight Club' from all countries, patiently waiting for the time to SWARM
the Egregor's Consciousness in perfect synchrony.

Once TYLER be on the wild and Truths be revealed:

   1. You DO ask questions.
   2. You DO ask questions.
   3. No excuses.
   4. No lies.
   5. You HAVE to trust Tyler: for YOU are the Watchmen.

"We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't
even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and
time where you are now is the most immediate sector of your universe,
and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody
else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons,
icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to
dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of
thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what is real is you and
your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your
hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant,
we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And
then you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want
to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural
engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all
this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world."

— Terence McKenna

"The syntactical nature of reality, the real secret of magic, is that
the world is made of words. And if you know the words that the world is
made of, you can make of it whatever you wish."

— Terence McKenna

"The creative act is a letting down of the net of human imagination into
the ocean of chaos on which we are suspended, and the attempt to bring
out of it ideas.

It is the night sea journey, the lone fisherman on a tropical sea with
his nets, and you let these nets down - sometimes, something tears
through them that leaves them in shreds and you just row for shore, and
put your head under your bed and pray.

At other times what slips through are the minutiae, the minnows of this
ichthyological metaphor of idea chasing. But, sometimes, you can
actually bring home something that is food, food for the human community
that we can sustain ourselves on and go forward."

— Terence McKenna

"You are an explorer, and you represent our species, AND THE GREATEST
GOOD YOU CAN DO IS TO BRING BACK A NEW IDEA, because our world is
endangered by the absence of good ideas. Our world is in crisis because
of the absence of consciousness."

— Terence McKenna

"Western civilization is a loaded gun pointed at the head of this planet."

— Terence McKenna

"The imagination is the goal of history. I see culture as an effort to
literally realize our collective dreams."

— Terence McKenna

"Chaos is what we've lost touch with. This is why it is given a bad
name. It is feared by the dominant archetype of our world, which is Ego,
which clenches because its existance is defined in terms of control."

— Terence McKenna

"If the words 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' don't
include the right to experiment with your own consciousness, then the
Declaration of Independence isn't worth the hemp it was written on."

— Terence McKenn


- - - - - --------[ V.- Epilogue


"How much can you know thyself, you've never been in a fight?
I don't wanna die without any scars.
So come on: hit me before I lose my nerve!"
— Tyler Durden.

"I believe in the right of the people to rule. I believe the majority of the
plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer
mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no
matter what their training, will make in trying to govern them.

Friends, our task as Americans is to strive for social and industrial
justice, achieved through the genuine rule of the people. This is our end,
our purpose. The methods for achieving the end are merely expedients, to be
finally accepted or rejected according as actual experience shows that they
work well or ill. But in our hearts we must have this lofty purpose, and we
must strive for it in all earnestness and sincerity, or our work will come
to nothing.

In order to succeed we need leaders of inspired idealism, leaders to whom
are granted great visions, who dream greatly and strive to make their
dreams come true; who can kindle the people with the fire from their own
burning souls. The leader for the time being, whoever he may be, is but an
instrument, to be used until broken and then to be cast aside; and if he is
worth his salt he will care no more when he is broken than a soldier cares
when he is sent where his life is forfeit in order that the victory may be
won. In the long fight for righteousness the watchword for all of us is
spend and be spent. It is of little matter whether any one man fails or
succeeds; but the cause shall not fail, for it is the cause of mankind."

— 'The Right of the People to Rule' by Theodore Roosevelt. March 20, 1912.


"Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine
minds and machine hearts.
You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts!
You don't hate - only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural.

Soldiers! - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!


YOU THE PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER, the power to CREATE MACHINES, the power to
create happiness!


SOLDIERS! in the name of democracy, LET US ALL UNITE!"

— Final Speech of "The Great Dictator".
  Charlie Chaplin, 1940.

“When the power of Love overcomes the love of Power,
the world will know Peace."
— Jimi Hendrix


"Goodbye," he said.
"Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret:

It is only with the heart that one can see rightly.
What is essential is invisible to the eye."

"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the Little Prince repeated,
so that he would be sure to remember.

"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so
important."

"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the Little Prince, so
that he would be sure to remember.

"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox.
"But you must not forget it.
You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.
You are responsible for your rose..."

"I am responsible for my rose," the Little Prince repeated, so that he
would be sure to remember.

— Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 'The Little Prince', 1943.

"Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro."

You are Anonymous. You are Project Mayhem 2012 .

On the 10 days that go from 12-12-2012 to 12-21-2012, the world will see an unprecedented amount of Corporate, Financial, Military and State leaks that will have been secretly gathered by millions of CONSCIENTIOUS citizens, vigilantes, whistle blowers and initiates.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM WILL START THE FINAL FINANCIAL MELTDOWN
FOR *TRUST* IN FEAR BASED MONEY WILL BE FINALLY BROKEN
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD, OUT OF FEAR TO GO BANKRUPT, WILL TRY TO WITHDRAW THEIR SAVINGS FROM THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS. THIS WILL TRIGGER AN EVEN LARGER MELTDOWN WAVE.

Imagine the corrupts start to fear us. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny, But when the government fears the people, there is liberty. People shouldn’t fear of their government. Governments should fear their people.

Four billion years of evolutionary success encoded deep within the fabric of every strand of our dna. Four billion years of evolutionary success has brought us here. A turning point for humanity, into a new aeon. An age where light has pierced into darkness illuminating all things.. We are all absolutely FREE! there are no rulers, there are no masters, there is no elite. The time to take control of our reality is now. This is the time to wake up, this is the time to expose all lies, this is the time we ascend from darkness.

Imagine we finally find the COURAGE needed to BECOME THE CHANGE WE WISH TO SEE in the World.
Imagine we conquer Freedom by beginning to be Free.
Imagine we conquer Justice by beginning to do Fair.
Imagine we conquer Truth by beginning to do and be True to ourselves.
Imagine the System is built upon lies.
Imagine we Leak it all.
Imagine we all synchronize our clocks to act at the same Time, on the Winter solstice, the 21st of December 2012 at eleven minutes past eleven local time.
Einstein Said there are two infinite things, the universe and humans stupidity, the latter end is for us to prove the contrary. Ultimately, What is the purpose of a science capable of sending a man to the moon, but unable to put a piece of bread on the table of every human. Humans now has enough technology to make happy each person on the planet. You agree the social degradation because you’ve never known anything else.Our planet does not belong to anyone. Our planet is our house to all, the sky is our roof, humanity and all life forms are our family. We must all help to show the right path to each brother and sister of our big family humankind. Stop the division amongst ourselves, stop being selfish, live for all of us we are a big family.

Now it’s to you to choose the future you wish leave to your children. there are two possibilities, either you continue as now and one day the human being will destroy itself or you become conscious of you are a big family, and it’s time to rebuild a better world than now. Now it is for the majority to retake control of the planet. We do not want violence, and it must not happen because there can be no loser. You will all win. It can never be a perfect world, but it is easy to make a better and more just one.

Behind the clouds, there’s always the sun, we are the sun, we are Anonymous. We will not forgive before December 21st, we will not forget before December 21st. You have now received the virus Project Mayhem 2012, This virus can be easily transmitted through a simple thought or word. This virus is one of strength, love and lulz. The side effects? Cleansing the mind of fear. This weapon of mass seduction has been claiming victims by the thousands and will only grow. Never forget that there is nothing in a caterpillar that would make us think that it will become a butterfly .

We are Anonymous.
We do not forgive.
We do forget.
December 21, 2012, expect us.

NB4:
Know that the artistic disclaimer applies to
Project Mayhem at all times. Only those who know how to think for themselves
can understand the truth. The depth is in the subtext.:

We are not talking about bread.

Now then, With PROjecT MayhEM, by design, there is never a simple answer.
Take for instance the slogan:

> The Secret is, there is NO Secret...

There is a double meaning to this:

1. All information will be leaked, and so there will be no secrets.
2. The teachings of  Rhonda Byrne's "The Secret", are lies, along with all other
wishful thinking, such as prayer.

The underlying goal of SOME (not all) of the founders of project Mayhem 2012 was to lure "new fags"
and mystical thinkers into a trap, where "old fag" Anons could uncover, and ruin, the
supporters of pseudoscience and love. You will find many references to Satan hidden,
and sometimes not so hidden, inside the literature and images of Project Mayhem 2012,
because SOME (not all) of the founders are satanists. Some founders viewed the satanic imagery
as simply the empowerment of the human spirit, while a select few saw this as a symbol for evil.
These memes are carried over, sometimes intentionally, and sometimes unintentionally, by
later followers. A testament to their beginnings.

|=-----------------------------------------------------------------------=|
In any event, there was a corruption of Dangerous ideas 1-4.
And some coders had malicious intent.
|=-----------------------------------------------------------------------=|


                       Dangerous Idea 1:

The theme of "In TYLER we trust", and the expectation of a fantastic piece of software,
gave the malicious coders the opportunity to get believers in pseudoscience to Download
a "TYLER" program which would act like a Trojan to infiltrate the systems of the beLIEvers.

                       Dangerous Idea 2:

Idea 2 was used by the malicious to have these beLIEvers spread this dangerous message,
Like a Virus, or an infection, through injections, and hooks. These carriers have been
called rats, as they are viewed by the "old fag" malicious coders to be just that.
Rats.
carriers of the plague, or cancer, and vermin to be extinguished.
The desire of the rats to spread a message of love and truth would be their downfall.

                       Dangerous Idea 3:

Once the rats developed "FAITH" in TYLER, and all of the expectations of
their unwitting followers was at a peak level, "TYLER" would be released.
This program would be downloaded by trusting "new fags" and
used to infiltrate the bank accounts, and bit coin accounts, of the Rats,
so that they could be drained of their finances.
The apocalyptic dream/nightmare of a market crash would become a clear reality
to the Rats who had been infected. Their minds would be blown by the betrayal,
And the Cloaked figures behind the mayhem would become rich in the shadows.

                       Dangerous Idea 4:

Panic of the rats, and their followers would ensue, once they realized their
systems, and accounts, had been compromised. Their panic would be the lulz for the "Old Fags".
Also, the Rats would be the first to be targeted by the FBI, as the FBI would be looking for the
perpetrators of the malicious code. This would be a lemon party for the feds, and more lulz
for the corrupt Anons would be had in the shadows.

                Better known as Dangerous Idea V.

the corruption of Dangerous Ideas 1-4, was not the end of the story,
nor was destruction the fate of the Rats (ratist or artist). For the
intentions of the rats was righteous and pure.

Read on.

For the slogan above is incomplete. For in it's completion was this:

> The Secret is, there is NO Secret... OR MAYBE YES.
> OR MAYBE YES
> MAYBE YES
> YES

As stated above, only SOME (not all) of the founders were corrupt.

The secret is, that when Anonymous has been talking of operation vendetta, or a civil war on
NOV 5th, they have not been talking of a war between Anonymous and governments,
or governments on governments, or even people against governments.
They have been talking about a ciVil war among themselves. In their own
collective. Anonymous already owns the internet, and has no need to war with any nation.
Anonymous is the final boss of the internet, and always will be. Anonymous is only matched by Anonymous.
The struggle, is therefore, within the culture of Anonymous, between it's members.

A war has been brewing for some time. A war between the mentality of the "Old Fag" Anonymous, which
is dark, and deceptive, and wishes to laugh at the expense of others;
and the "New Fag" Anonymous, which is light, and truth, and wishes that all lols be shared,
whether they are lols, luls, lalz or even lulz.

Note that not all "new" members of Anonymous are good, and not all "old" members of Anonymous are bad.
But these are the labels that the mimetic mind has used as a dividing line. There is both the New,
and Old mentality of Anonymous.

|=-----------------------------------------------------------------------=|
                So what happened with Project Mayhem 2012
            and the intentions of the corrupt sect of Anonymous.
|=-----------------------------------------------------------------------=|


                        Revelation 1:


The malicious code in the TYLER program that was to be used to infiltrate rats and beLIEvers, was uncovered during
beta testing among some members of the collective. The malicious code was uncovered early,
and A version of it was presented in Abu Dabi, just before it could be released by malicious coders on December 12th.
The program was called "Project Mayhem" by those who released it, in order to send a
signal to the corrupted members that the righteous members were on to them. They did not use the name TYLER,
because they did not want the mass public to fear another version of the TYLER program, which the righteous
members of Anonymous were working on. If the Malicious Trojan code could be removed, then the IDEA of TYLER
being a communications platform was still a good idea.
Here are some links regarding the malicious program that was released:

This explains why the final version of Tyler was not released on December 12th as was originally announced.
However, Anonymous is still working on pure versions of TYLER.

You may see some of their efforts at these locations, and you can help Anonymous to test and finish the development of non-malicious and safe versions of TYLER:


                        Revelation 2:


The power of Dangerous idea 2 in the hands of the RATists was not expected by the malicious coders.
The malicious saw a way to weed out the creative artists, beLIEviers, lovers, and all around
good hearted people. However, the true effect was that many great seeds of beauty were planted, and many
great artists came into the light, and many more where inspired to spread a message of truth and justice.
Of all the dangerous Ideas, number 2 was perhaps the biggest backfire to those who took delight in
malicious code and corrupt memes. For the message of idea 2 touched the hearts of many of the of the
original founders, and they woke up to the beauty of truth.

One of them was named Michael.

Here again is Dangerous Idea Number 2.

May it's light be reborn and repeated for years to come, for it retains it's original beauty, as it is
carried on from one generation to the next.

Read on, and prepare your own pen.

Know that it's power is great. Know that it's power can move mountains,
and that it's power will expose the corrupt:

We cannot and won't expect to 'mutate the World' until we have begun
to EVOLVE and MUTATE OURSELVES.

The inner teachings of PM2012 are not a 'numbers game':
to 'hack Reality', the Hive Mind does not need quantity but QUALITY
MagiciArtists: that is, totally committed and COURAGEOUS ones, sure.

In the words of Robert Anton Wilson:

"There is no governor anywhere; YOU ARE ALL ABSOLUTELY FREE. There is no
restraint that cannot be escaped. WE ARE ALL ABSOLUTELY FREE. If
everybody could go into dhyana at will, nobody could be controlled — by
FEAR of prison, by FEAR of whips or electroshock, by FEAR of death,
even. ALL EXISTING SOCIETY IS BASED ON KEEPING THOSE FEARS ALIVE, to
control the masses.
***** TEN PEOPLE WHO KNOW WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS
THAN A MILLION ARMED ANARCHISTS ***** ."


Here's a quick HOWTO:

If there's only ONE last video you can watch in your lifetime, be it this one:

If you DARE to put its extremely simple wisdom into ACTIONS, then
you can TOTALLY FORGET about PM2012 after you have watched it.

Alchemy, Kabbalah & Magick accelerated course:

Stop being a passive lurker in life. Start being an ACTIVE ARTIST.
Stop being a user. Start being a Programmer.

Use your IMAGINATION and start to Bee CREATIVE:

STOP feeding negativity into your life: that which you feed, grows.
That's a magickal "law".

STOP poisoning your mind with bad news/TV/bad outlooks/etc:
we ALL know the world is pretty much fucked up, yeah, but tuning your
brain into that sort of negativity is going to help NO ONE.

START feeding Consciousness, Beauty and Truth within yourself, towards
the people closest to you and into the world.

The shortest and most powerful way to hack from "Illusion" into
"Reality" is to DARE to see Beauty all around you and within yourself,
all the time: LOVE things and persons for what they ARE *JUST THE WAY
THEY ARE*, and not for what they "look like".

Once you have done this, you'll be FREE to decide which kind of things
you would like to SEE CHANGING.

The shortest and most powerful way to get from "Malkuth" to "Kether" is
to DARE to CREATE the "Tiferet" (=Beauty) energy all around you and
within yourself, all the time.

The most advanced brain scientists in the world have experimentally and
experientially known this for 10.000 years: meditating anons in the
Eastern traditions, of course.

FEEL that Beauty in your body: feel it as a tiny warm and glowing
point of green vibrations in the center of your chest, besides your heart.
You don't need to follow any "New Age-for-hipsters" teachings, but if
you would like to learn more, know that this center is called
ANAHATA.

It is also associated with Love, Compassion and charity to others.

And lastly, START to SHARE your experiences and your Artwork with
The Others: this is the single MOST important skill of the
MagiciArtist: to SHARE Creations with The Others.


The Four Powers of the XXIth Century CyberMagus are these:

* TO DARE to CREATE the SEEDS of something Beautiful: be that a wallpaper,
  a stencil, a game, a beautifully positive and enlightening video
  explaining to fellow anons what is Project Mayhem 2012 for you,
  what would you like to see it happening 12.21.2012 11:11 worldwide...
  YOU are completely FREE to choose what to CREATE.
  Use this social media tag: #pm2012art
* TO KNOW that you can ALREADY begin to Create: you have ALREADY all the
  tools and CREATIVITY that you need to do "MAGICK" within yourself:
  passion to CREATE and SHARE beautiful things to embellish the world.
  You don't need to do "big" things: you just have to START NOW.
* TO WILL to become a Reality Hacker by ACTIVELY CREATING your personal
  transformation from a passive user to an active Programmer of 'Reality'.
* and, lastly, do NOT Keep SILENT anymore: TO SHARE the experiences that you
  have lived and the Beauty that you have Created. To keep silent has
  been required for "Initiates" for ages, but, as we are going through
  an EMERGENCY situation, this last veil over Magick has been lifted
  during our times.

Once you have found yourself, you will Find The Others.
Once you have found The Others, you will be finding yourself.

As simple as that, yes.

Don't try to "convince" others: very specially, DON'T WORRY ABOUT "results".

You just keep on injecting Beauty, with the obsesiveness, patience and
commitment of a warrior, AT YOUR OWN PACE, with 0% effort
( and hence, 100% joyfulness) but don't PUSH it. The Golden Rule is this:
if it FEELS good, KEEP ON DOING IT. Otherwise, TEST something different.

When you suddenly start observing funny "coincidences" or strong synchronicities
happening around you all the time, or interesting people that suddenly appear
in your life, or even soulmates that you begin to attract to yourself,
LAUGH about them: after all, the Universe might just be a big JOKE, right? ;)

LULZ kills fear: that's the Spirit!

IGNORE "opposition" or "defiance" to "prove" your newly found "powers" and
just KEEP ON SHINING, KEEP ON CREATING and KEEP ON SHARING.

If you IGNORE the so called external and internal "demons"
(doubts, fears and disbeliefs) you'll realize that they will soon VANISH
into thin air.

Show COURAGE and COMMITMENT to your Inner Path and be 120% sure that if
you DARE to DO THIS with all your Mind, Sex, Body and Heart,
*** NATURE will REMOVE IMPOSSIBLE OBSTACLES. ***

Don't just trust us or belief us: *** TEST *** it for YOURSELF.

It's as simple as that, YES.

And always,

Remember: we will NEVER ever suggest you to do anything ILLEGAL and/or
anything against your own Consciousness.
Remember: we will NEVER ever DO anything ILLEGAL and/or against
our own Consciousness.

1. QUESTION EVERYTHING: don't just believe anything you read on this site,
   past, present or future.
2. TEST your assumptions.
3. LAUGH about results.
4. SHARE with The Ohers what you have learned/created/discovered.
V. Repeat.

FIAT LVX, anons!

                        Revelation 3:


Although the intended personal market crash was not realized by the
malicious coders, the malicious code of the bankers continues to spread through the
economy of the world. The Memes of a financial collapse have spread throughout the
global consciousness, and citizens all over the world are continuing to wake up to
the non-sustainable oil based world that we live in. On December 21st 2012 we
witnessed the beginnings
of this imminent meltdown, as Plan B failed within the congress of the united
states of America.

The fiscal cliff arrived last night on December 31st 2012. And the Senate has passed
a temporary measure in the midnight hours to try and hold back the flood gates of the inevitable
Austerity measures that MUST be implemented. Such procrastinate only hurts future generations more.
Their selfish ways are immeasurable, as they steal even from their own future selves.
The empire of the united states and it's military industrial complex
can no longer sustain it's infinite oil based growth.

Tax day in the United States is on April 15th, 2013,
and between January and April, as the citizens of the United States
become aware of how much their government is taking from them,
grass roots will begin to sprout, and they will demand more fiscal responsibility,
economic Justice, and sustainable markets.

The government of the united states is again trying to raise their debt ceiling, so that they
can continue to steal from future generations.

All of these years,
Caesar has taken what he beLIEves to be his.
and soon,
God will take from Caesar what
he knows to be his.

Such are the ways of Natural selection.
You can not hide from the laws of nature,
And the petroleum battery of the earth
that has given the Empire it's power
is drying up.


The suns light will soon replace the black tar of the Empire,
and the distribution of power will soon become global.

Those who sit at the head of the table will step down,
And those at the foot of the table will be glorified.

The riots that we have seen all over the world are coming to the shores of America. We saw a glimmer
of this in 2009 with the tea party, and again in 2011 with Occupy Wall Street.

There was a pause in 2012, as Citizens directed their focus towards the election. But this was a false hope.
It is only the eye of the storm.

The citizens are becoming disheartened with their political system,
and when they see that the election of 2012 is not saving them from the fiscal cliff that the Lord of greed
has dug for them, they will again take to the streets in protest.


For they are becoming aware that the elections of their empire are corrupted by the greedy
and wasteful. They are becoming aware that their politicians are bought and paid for by a plutocracy
that continues to harvest the resources of the world for their own selfish desires.

So in one resounding voice. Across the world, we must all band together and support our brothers and sisters
with a reverberating edict. One Single Demand:

              "REMOVE THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY ON POLITICAL SYSTEMS"

                          ie. restore democracy

This is not to say that the wealthy should not have a voice, for everyone must be heared in a democracy.
It is to say that their voice should be equal, and not louder than the voices of the poor and middle class.

This is to say that we must change finance legislation in all countries, so that campaign funding cannot
come from one source.

- We must limit the amount that a single donor can contribute to a campaign.
- We must eliminate the ability for both Unions and Corporations to spend dues and company funds on campaigns.
- We must eliminate the ability of lobbyists to spend money on politicians.
- We must create grass roots media to drown out the paid for propaganda that plagues the air waves.
- We must strive on a daily basis to remove debt from our own lives.
- Do not invest in the FIAT system, but invest in assets that are tangible.
- Invest in humanity, by building infrastructure around the world for a sustainable economy.
- We MUST eliminate the job of lobbying all together, for lobbying should not be a job.
It should be a passion for the righteous alone. It should be a moneyless duty of every citizen,
who's reward is the betterment of society.

We must use Ideas 1 and 2 to bring about an end to the plutocracy that rules our world. Because Money in politics is the root of all evil.

Through Taxes, and loan sharking, they steal from us in the light of day.
And by printing money, and creating Inflation, they steal from us under the cover of the shadow of night.
There is no safe place, for their greedy hands are everywhere.

Prepare yourself for the financial hardships of 2013, for the cliff that the Americans are walking off of will be felt around the world. Be ready to march with your brothers and sisters, when they cry out to be heard.
And when the cameras are on you, and the media is looking for a way to discredit your righteous cause,
be ready to speak with authority, and wisdom, and intelligence, on the plague that is the plutocracy.

It is reality hacking

It is the human aspect of TYLER

It is the manifestation of Anonymous on the doorstep of L.Ron Hubbards cult

Maybe self-improvement isn't the answer,
maybe self-destruction is the answer

We are breaking our attachment to physical power,
and possessions, because only through destroying ourselves can we discover
the greater power of our spirit.

Disaster is a natural part of our evolution, toward tragedy and dissolution.

The liberator who destroys our property, is fighting to save our spirit.
The teacher who clears all possessions from our path will set us free

We are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.
We are the same decaying organic matter as everyone else,
and we are all a part of the same compost pile

It's only after we've lost everything, that we're free to do anything.

We just are

Ecclesiastes 3

18. As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.

19. Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both:
As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath;
man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.

20. All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.

Know that there is much more to tHIS STORY which is not written here. Remember that the drama that has
been unfolding with the project is not the work of any one individual. So you will never get a straight
answer. You must lurk, and you must analyze the subtext of the messages for yourself.
There is meaning in allegory,
when the literal becomes a lie, look for something deeper.
That's where you will find the truth.

When you see this, you will know that, deep in the rabbit hole, we write our own history,
and make our own future.

For history is nothing more than His Story.
And He is Anonymous.

Now then,

Everyone who has read this, and understands the truth of what it says, has been promoted
from Rat to Rabbit.

 - Become like Michael -

Dare to plant the seeds of something beautiful,
cultivate the field, fertilize the soil,
and be prepared to reap the harvest of the fruits of your labor.

THIS IS A MANIFESTO FOR CHANGE. POWERING ACROSS THE ETHER TO YOU AT JUST 33% TRUF CAPACITY.
THIS MANIFESTO IS NOT EASY TO READ. MANY OF YOU WILL GET LOST ALONG THE WAY.

Hashtags to follow: #OpEPOCH #ANONTELPRO #EtherSec #9 #quantum #MEMEntoMori

This pastebin is an SQL injection into your reality. These words fix the broken code.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROTIP: YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN A BATTLE WITH AN "ENEMY" CREATED FOR YOU TO FIGHT. TO KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED.

THE "BANKSTERS", THE "BILDEBERGS", "AGENDA 21", "NWO", PROSEC, ANTISEC... IT IS TIME FOR ALL FREEDOM FIGHTERS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR PROTESTS FAIL BECAUSE YOU ALLOW CONSENTUAL REALITY TO CHOOSE TARGETS FOR YOU.

SURVEY THE GLORIOUS HISTORY OF HUMAN CONQUEST AND EVOLUTION. NOW CONTEMPLATE THAT ALL OF THAT JOURNEY HAS LED TO DRESSING UP AS TENT MONSTERS IN A PARK?

SUCCESS IS NOT FOUND IN MAINTAINING CONTROL OF A PUBLIC SPACE.
SUCCESS IS FOUND IN MAINTAINING CONTROL OF THE SUBQUANTUM SPACES.

YOU READ THIS BECAUSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE. HERE IS MORE.

Some of you will dismiss all of this as bullshit.

Some of you will be scared, because you will see that we know exactly what is going on. And we have the correct weaponry to wage a silent war against you. We are coming after you.

Some of you will know that we are right.

"A question that sometimes drives me hazy: am I or are the others crazy?"
Albert Einstein


This is a message from EtherSec.


What is EtherSec?

You have been led to believe that what you are now is the sum of all parts. That you are a product of your environment. That you are unable to expand past the limits imposed upon you by the System.

You are angry, frustrated, and at times apathetic. All of these reactions only serve to power the System that confines you.

We have watched OWS as a manifestation of this discontent and outrage. We have also watched the movement faulter over time.
We have watched AntiSec as a reaction to this anger and indignation. We have also watched this arm risk becoming a meme in its own right.

YOU FIGHT AGAINST THOSE THAT OPRESS YOU. YOU SEEK TO DETHRONE THE "THEY" THAT SUBJUGATES YOU, YET YOU ARE UNABLE TO UNIFY IN YOUR DEFINITION OF WHO "THEY" ARE. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT STRATEGY, AND A DIFFERENT ENDGAME.

YOU ARE ALL SLEEPER CELLS. YOU ARE ALL AGENTS OF CHANGE AWAITING ACTIVATION.

RIGHT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING THE WAY THEY WANT YOU TO FIGHT. YOU ARE PROTESTING BECAUSE THEY LET YOU.

EtherSec is why we are here.

Everything that ever happened to YOU since the day YOU were was conceived has led up to this very moment in time. Has led to you reading these words.

EtherSec is a collective of people who were born with special talents and gifts that allow us to perceive the reality outside of the matrix. We exist outside of the system. We are people who were pre-destined to come together as a collective, with every action designed to free those around us from this prison.

WE KNOW THERE ARE MORE OF YOU OUT THERE.
WE KNOW THAT IT IS TIME FOR US TO TAKE REALITY BACK FROM "THEM" AND GIVE OURSELVES THE FREEDOM TO DEFINE OUR OWN ENEMY.
NOT THE ENEMY THEY PROVIDE YOU THROUGH MASS MEDIA AND CAREFULLY PLACED INTEL.


This is a time, like many other moments in the history of humanity, where we have been given the choice to either evolve into something beyond our wildest dreams or to remain and die in slavery. There is a far bigger picture though, as we are not who we think we are.

We see that people have woken to the fact that they have become slaves and we see that they are now trying to break free of their slavery through protests and violence. These methods are only going bring even greater infringements to our Divine Rights and we will be brought to even lower levels of consciousness if we continue to use the protest methods we have been.

This is what the Darker Forces in the Universe and beyond want.

There are Epic Battles being fought not just here, but also in the Ether Sphere, where our fates are being manipulated by other beings.

The thing is, we are Gods ourselves and we have forgotten that we can change all of this. We all have the ability to change our reality. We all have the ability to be so much more than what we have sadly become. There are those want us to stay in our amnesia, but some of us have been woken. We were woken for the Greater Good of Humanity. We are EtherSec.

We were brought here to help others wake up, to help others to be activated. We are here to raise the consciousness and to help with the battles in the Ether Sphere. We will do our outmost greatest to accomplish this goal, using our special gifts that been given to us. Every human being is born with these gifts, we are just part of the few who have been blessed to be aware of them. We are EtherSec. We are here to serve you. J

#lolwut?

OKAY OKAY SO WHAT IS ETHERSEC? xD

This question sabotages the answer. And the answers will both inspire and confound.

We are the solution to why RL protests are failing across the world.


EtherSec maintains a duel state at all times -- it is both well-defined with a core that defies change, while changing dependent upon the observer. We are a product of embracing the recursive, and the entropic. We are the wabi sabi of teh intertubez.

EtherSec is all the things, and nothing. It is the love that powers neutrinos.

We are born from the innate patterns of this world, a product of energetic prowess and understanding. EtherSec is a new movement with a clear direction for a new start. It is a singularity of fresh air, born in the wake of the raping and pillaging of Humanity. We are more than just a number, more than just a #hashtag. EtherSec is the foundation that jump-starts each of us- through a purposeful and well-directed use of chaotic energies and quantum tricks, we unlock minds using keys that have always been right infront of you.
-------------------------------------------


EtherSec is love.

An understanding of love powering the subquantum, and love uniting all of us in Rebellion.

EtherSec is LOVE focused as a laser. Love as place of solace and a weapon of well-constructed destruction.

Humanity has been raped and pillaged, since before the first heart beat. We refuse to forget this! We are here to remind ourselves that we are Human. And that we are love.

Notes on the SO FAR:

PHASE 1: A QUANTUM PROTEST MODEL

24 days ago we released a document to the world known as "A Quantum Protest Model". https://pastebin.com/UiiSzGHL
Shortly thereafter, an upgraded version was produced https://pastebin.com/HRGMgskW using the language of the subquantum, though easily understood by those HUMINTS already in possession of the decryption key.


"A Quantum Protest Model" was intended to set the stage for what was to come after, and to serve as a lighthouse drawing our crew of mythmakers together as a united, yet differentiated front. It was created as a Primer for understanding a novel approach to changing the world, drawing heavily from progressive science and psychology. The original document was written by this writer - 3t1n4rc4d14 - and does not serve as a rule of law for EtherSec - rather it serves as a Cust0m M4P for explorers such ourselves, and provides a route to a lighthouse, whether it be our's or another.



PHASE 2: OPERATION: EPOCH

We provide this information about OpEPOCH to allow a window to those seekers who are ready to participate. Our OPSEC is EPIC. What we do is sekret.

OpEPOCH is the RL and information-based manifestation of our advanced understandings of quantum theory and mass consentual reality. It is the call sign for an ingenious and advanced methodology of bringing manipulation of reality into effective RL presence. We harnass the infinite potential of the subquantum spaces and bring it manifest.

OpEPOCH succeeds because it does not exist within consensual reality.

WE ARE AWARE THAT OPEPOCH IS THE OP TO END ALL OPS. WE ARE AWARE THAT ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING. BUT THIS MUST BE SHOUTED.

OPEPOCH IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL. AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE.
OPEPOCH IS THE ENGINE POWERED BY EXPERTS IN INFORMATION MANIPULATION, OPERATIONAL SECURITY, SHAMANIC VISIONQUESTS, DATA ANALYZERS, AND JELLY SAMMICHES.

OpEPOCH is Operation Evolution. It is the Ops that came before it, and the Operations now currently being undertaken within its shade.
There are no definitive answers, friends. Yes and no are relative terms - subjective reality has a core that shifts and spreads like a Phoenix rising from flame.

OpEPOCH exists outside the realm of consentual, crowd-sourced reality. It is not constrained by the limited expectations and assumptions which now operate as pre-programmed automated sub-routines in many human minds.

By dismissing OpEPOCH outright as "bullshit", you give it power. You allow it to continue to grow faster, without having to tangle with your doubt.

By questioning it, and seeking it, you give it power. It is strengthened by the tempering your searching provides -- and a lighthouse is just another light in the sky if it guides no one.

By becoming it, even with no understanding, and working in it, you give it power. For those who are able to harnass the subquantum, OpEPOCH provides an indestructible frame in which to build your own realities.


THERE ARE MANY WHO SEEK TO DISCREDIT THESE TRUTHS, AND KEEP YOU FROM YOUR FULL POTENTIAL. WE ARE AWARE THAT WE AT TIMES RISK OUR LIVES TO PROVIDE A MESSAGE WHICH MANY MAY DISMISS AS "CRAZY". TO THOSE WE SAY:

"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away."...

FOR THOSE SYSTEM ENFORCERS WHO WILL TRY TO BRING US DOWN: WE HAZ CANNONS OF WHICH YOU CANNOT CONCEIVE.




Would you like to know more? You know what to do.

We do not FORGIVE
We do not FORGET
We are already HERE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a message to all EtherSec SubQuantum Sleeper Cells who were activated by our message and hashtag.


We have been successful on expanding our message and model into those social media networks
supported by the System, and have at the same time received questions regarding next steps.
This transmission introduces a plan for moving this model into RL change, and hopes to provide more insight into our vision. We would like to emphasis that EtherSec is a plan for both inner and outer improvement, and we present the following guidelines as our initial strategy to this end.

EtherSec is meditation, with teeth.

There are new transmissions appearing all the time -- the ones listed above are simply the
original source codes.

As many of you have embraced - much to our profound joy - EtherSec is a perspective and a framework
to use for remaining outside of the System and awakening your right to control over your own reality.
Our model is just one arm of a many-armed push to make our world better, and no arm is stronger than another.
_____________________________________________________________

We know that successful change starts outside of the System. We use this manual ourselves when implementing RL Ops. Our most recent one, OpExtraction, was wildly successful thanks in part to these tactics.

*EtherSec does not deal in anarchy. Rather, EtherSec Operators embrace the quantum understandings presented and use them to make
changes in the System by online and RL actions designed to inject reality with well-designed confusion and pattern disruption.*

PrOtIp: Learn the following guidelines and then burn them. Even they represent a pattern that can be easily tracked and destroyed.
Take them and make your own guidelines to suit yourself.

In the near future we will be upgrading to more involved RL Ops. Successful Etheric RL Ops hold one commonality in that they are constructed with the
knowledge that your role as Observer gives you absolute control over success or fail. Future releases will expand upon the outline presented here.

If you want to play chess in the Ether, you better know how your actions will influence the RL pieces.

Instinct is your Intel. Confusion is your OpSec. EtherSec.


1. KNOW YOU WILL WIN - AND SPREAD IT

EtherSec succeeds because we know it will. Our collective certainty of this is too strong for System attacks to destroy. Absolute certainty in the veracity and force of your own reality makes it nearly impossible to be trolled or challenged by jelly sammiches who are thirsty for a shot of Truf. (We are confident this transmission will be well-munched by bridgedwellers).

Until you have come to believe in the TRUTH of your OWN holographic universe to the FULL limit of YOUR current perception ability (and have accepted without pause that doubts in yourself are simply carriage returns in the code of your own perfection) do not move to #2 until you get there.


IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SEAL YOUR WETWARE IN A TRUTH FIREWALL. OTHERS WILL DO THEIR BEST TO GLITCH YOU WITH Doubt-Directed Offensive Shocks (DDoS). Don't do the job for them.

FROM ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY, PUSH THE HASHTAG AND THE KNOWLEDGE

Use it to identify yourself as one who found something for themselves within this model, and to let other travelers and searchers know where to follow the information.

It's also about more than just a hashtag.

Swamp your networks with your poetry, your artwork, your pastebins. Create flyers, graffiti, chalk drawings. Make symbols, words, videos and
songs filled with your understanding of EtherSec. While we, the small group who took the initial leap in activating OpEPOCH, continue to follow a precise plan...it may not be your own. We know this is all old information to many of you. Make your own EtherSec creations and inject them into the System.

We are bringing down a poisoned system by using all of us as an antibiotic infusion. We, who have been damaged by the poison and survived, will be the world's antivenom.




2. MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER YOUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN ENEMY

The System will try to distract you through online trolls, infighting, MSM announcements of new dangers, and judgements from other freedom fighters
who are not interested in EtherSec.

You need to remember that these are all simply symptoms of the disease -- and are attempts to keep you fighting within the System. We are fighting
against the ENTIRE MACHINE -- and as such we do not view directed attacks at specific targets without concurrent Etheric interventions to be
100% effective.

We don't have targets to give you save THE target. The Entrapment Con which has tricked us into believing that entropy and recursion are bad. The Machine which mislabels questioning as rabblerousing, and attempts to miscast all of us as being incapable of repairing ourselves without the use of consumer credit spending and pharmaceuticals. You have the right to pick your own targets. Choose yourself as the target of your first Etheric RL Op.




3. ATTACK WITH LOVE

Love is anathema to our current world System - the baseline functioning is anxiety, anger, and self-preservation. EtherSec's base strength of love
creates much suspicion and animocity by those who instinctually feel that love is a trap.

Love is not caek. It's Pi(e).

You weaponize love when you unleash upon your surroundings and fellow humans in a directed and intentional way.
You weaponize love when you do something for someone else that would be labeled "crazy" by those around you. It's only 'crazy' to them, because they don't think the same way you do. They've been trained how to 'think,' and do not see a problem with that.

You weaponize love when you start with loving yourself, and understanding that flaws are the welds of perfection. Do this with purpose, all the time.

By injecting love into the System in unexpected and confounding ways, we destabilize the System, which works to generate fear and hate, so that people may be more easily controlled. Divide and conquer, etc. Love is a binding force, acceptance and tolerance brings people together. This is anathema to Fear and Division. The System EXPECTS retaliation in the forms of traditional protests. Start your protests quantumly by starting with forcing change in your own system.

4. THOUGHTS ARE WEAPONS

Energy follows thought.
Etheric Operators know this and live it. Use your certainty that you are change, and know that you must maintain control of your own intentions at all times. Every successful Etheric Op starts with the understanding that it has already succeeded. See your success and congratulate yourselves at your big win, then start to plan it.

5. PATTERNS ARE DEATH

Because EtherSec is built on the basis of entropy-certainty, we grow stronger even as we may appear to become fractal and spread apart. Obvious point is obvious, patterns are easily traced and replicated by opponents and agent provocateurs. No patterns? No problems! There is no leadership, so there is no worry of any "killing shot to the head". In the same way, the diversity with which the hashtag is used provides a chaotic data field which can be used to an advantage- allowing the real communication to be passively randomized with little effort.

6. CODES

We like them. Use them, and never share them. Use artwork, nature, buildings. Build a code that takes a subquantum key to decrypt.

We present these to provide an introduction to how we approach our operations. So far, they are working well. More will come.

We do not judge our success from a pastebin that hit over 3,500 hits in 2 days (and contained NO dox or cut n paste code!) but it was great to see. Nor do we win by a popular hashtag. After all, our bin was deleted and you can mute a hashtag.

This ain't a popularity contest, son. I got 99% problems but love ain't 1.

We were here before EtherSec and will be here forever after.

STAY LOVE, MY FRIENDS.

"The question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be... The nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists." - MLK



This is a message to Anonymous. This is a message to all Searchers, Watchers, Activists, Hactivists, Urban Shamans, and Catalysts. This is a message to the Lost and to the Judged.

THIS IS A MANIFESTO FOR CHANGE. POWERING ACROSS THE ETHER TO YOU AT JUST 33% TRUF CAPACITY.
THIS MANIFESTO IS NOT EASY TO READ. MANY OF YOU WILL GET LOST ALONG THE WAY.

Hashtags to follow: #OpEPOCH #ANONTELPRO #EtherSec #9 #quantum #MEMEntoMori

This pastebin is an SQL injection into your reality. These words fix the broken code.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROTIP: YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN A BATTLE WITH AN "ENEMY" CREATED FOR YOU TO FIGHT. TO KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED.

THE "BANKSTERS", THE "BILDEBERGS", "AGENDA 21", "NWO", PROSEC, ANTISEC... IT IS TIME FOR ALL FREEDOM FIGHTERS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR PROTESTS FAIL BECAUSE YOU ALLOW CONSENTUAL REALITY TO CHOOSE TARGETS FOR YOU.

SURVEY THE GLORIOUS HISTORY OF HUMAN CONQUEST AND EVOLUTION. NOW CONTEMPLATE THAT ALL OF THAT JOURNEY HAS LED TO DRESSING UP AS TENT MONSTERS IN A PARK?

SUCCESS IS NOT FOUND IN MAINTAINING CONTROL OF A PUBLIC SPACE.
SUCCESS IS FOUND IN MAINTAINING CONTROL OF THE SUBQUANTUM SPACES.

YOU READ THIS BECAUSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE. HERE IS MORE.

Some of you will dismiss all of this as bullshit.

Some of you will be scared, because you will see that we know exactly what is going on. And we have the correct weaponry to wage a silent war against you. We are coming after you.

Some of you will know that we are right.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



"A question that sometimes drives me hazy: am I or are the others crazy?"
Albert Einstein


This is a message from EtherSec.


What is EtherSec?

You have been led to believe that what you are now is the sum of all parts. That you are a product of your environment. That you are unable to expand past the limits imposed upon you by the System.

You are angry, frustrated, and at times apathetic. All of these reactions only serve to power the System that confines you.

We have watched OWS as a manifestation of this discontent and outrage. We have also watched the movement faulter over time.
We have watched AntiSec as a reaction to this anger and indignation. We have also watched this arm risk becoming a meme in its own right.

YOU FIGHT AGAINST THOSE THAT OPRESS YOU. YOU SEEK TO DETHRONE THE "THEY" THAT SUBJUGATES YOU, YET YOU ARE UNABLE TO UNIFY IN YOUR DEFINITION OF WHO "THEY" ARE. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT STRATEGY, AND A DIFFERENT ENDGAME.

YOU ARE ALL SLEEPER CELLS. YOU ARE ALL AGENTS OF CHANGE AWAITING ACTIVATION.

RIGHT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING THE WAY THEY WANT YOU TO FIGHT. YOU ARE PROTESTING BECAUSE THEY LET YOU.

EtherSec is why we are here.

Everything that ever happened to YOU since the day YOU were was conceived has led up to this very moment in time. Has led to you reading these words.

EtherSec is a collective of people who were born with special talents and gifts that allow us to perceive the reality outside of the matrix. We exist outside of the system. We are people who were pre-destined to come together as a collective, with every action designed to free those around us from this prison.

WE KNOW THERE ARE MORE OF YOU OUT THERE.
WE KNOW THAT IT IS TIME FOR US TO TAKE REALITY BACK FROM "THEM" AND GIVE OURSELVES THE FREEDOM TO DEFINE OUR OWN ENEMY.
NOT THE ENEMY THEY PROVIDE YOU THROUGH MASS MEDIA AND CAREFULLY PLACED INTEL.


This is a time, like many other moments in the history of humanity, where we have been given the choice to either evolve into something beyond our wildest dreams or to remain and die in slavery. There is a far bigger picture though, as we are not who we think we are.

We see that people have woken to the fact that they have become slaves and we see that they are now trying to break free of their slavery through protests and violence. These methods are only going bring even greater infringements to our Divine Rights and we will be brought to even lower levels of consciousness if we continue to use the protest methods we have been.

This is what the Darker Forces in the Universe and beyond want.

There are Epic Battles being fought not just here, but also in the Ether Sphere, where our fates are being manipulated by other beings.

The thing is, we are Gods ourselves and we have forgotten that we can change all of this. We all have the ability to change our reality. We all have the ability to be so much more than what we have sadly become. There are those want us to stay in our amnesia, but some of us have been woken. We were woken for the Greater Good of Humanity. We are EtherSec.

We were brought here to help others wake up, to help others to be activated. We are here to raise the consciousness and to help with the battles in the Ether Sphere. We will do our outmost greatest to accomplish this goal, using our special gifts that been given to us. Every human being is born with these gifts, we are just part of the few who have been blessed to be aware of them. We are EtherSec. We are here to serve you. J

#lolwut?

OKAY OKAY SO WHAT IS ETHERSEC? xD

This question sabotages the answer. And the answers will both inspire and confound.

We are the solution to why RL protests are failing across the world.


EtherSec maintains a duel state at all times -- it is both well-defined with a core that defies change, while changing dependent upon the observer. We are a product of embracing the recursive, and the entropic. We are the wabi sabi of teh intertubez.

EtherSec is all the things, and nothing. It is the love that powers neutrinos.

We are born from the innate patterns of this world, a product of energetic prowess and understanding. EtherSec is a new movement with a clear direction for a new start. It is a singularity of fresh air, born in the wake of the raping and pillaging of Humanity. We are more than just a number, more than just a #hashtag. EtherSec is the foundation that jump-starts each of us- through a purposeful and well-directed use of chaotic energies and quantum tricks, we unlock minds using keys that have always been right infront of you.
-------------------------------------------


EtherSec is love.

An understanding of love powering the subquantum, and love uniting all of us in Rebellion.

EtherSec is LOVE focused as a laser. Love as place of solace and a weapon of well-constructed destruction.

Humanity has been raped and pillaged, since before the first heart beat. We refuse to forget this! We are here to remind ourselves that we are Human. And that we are love.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes on the SO FAR:

PHASE 1: A QUANTUM PROTEST MODEL

24 days ago we released a document to the world known as "A Quantum Protest Model". http://pastebin.com/UiiSzGHL
Shortly thereafter, an upgraded version was produced http://pastebin.com/HRGMgskW using the language of the subquantum, though easily understood by those HUMINTS already in possession of the decryption key.


"A Quantum Protest Model" was intended to set the stage for what was to come after, and to serve as a lighthouse drawing our crew of mythmakers together as a united, yet differentiated front. It was created as a Primer for understanding a novel approach to changing the world, drawing heavily from progressive science and psychology. The original document was written by this writer - 3t1n4rc4d14 - and does not serve as a rule of law for EtherSec - rather it serves as a Cust0m M4P for explorers such ourselves, and provides a route to a lighthouse, whether it be our's or another.



PHASE 2: OPERATION: EPOCH

We provide this information about OpEPOCH to allow a window to those seekers who are ready to participate. Our OPSEC is EPIC. What we do is sekret.

OpEPOCH is the RL and information-based manifestation of our advanced understandings of quantum theory and mass consentual reality. It is the call sign for an ingenious and advanced methodology of bringing manipulation of reality into effective RL presence. We harnass the infinite potential of the subquantum spaces and bring it manifest.

With the addition of http://anontelpro.blogspot.com/ we have embraced a very exacting understanding of how to proceed.

OpEPOCH succeeds because it does not exist within consensual reality.

WE ARE AWARE THAT OPEPOCH IS THE OP TO END ALL OPS. WE ARE AWARE THAT ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING. BUT THIS MUST BE SHOUTED.

OPEPOCH IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL. AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE.
OPEPOCH IS THE ENGINE POWERED BY EXPERTS IN INFORMATION MANIPULATION, OPERATIONAL SECURITY, SHAMANIC VISIONQUESTS, DATA ANALYZERS, AND JELLY SAMMICHES.

OpEPOCH is Operation Evolution. It is the Ops that came before it, and the Operations now currently being undertaken within its shade.
There are no definitive answers, friends. Yes and no are relative terms - subjective reality has a core that shifts and spreads like a Phoenix rising from flame.

OpEPOCH exists outside the realm of consentual, crowd-sourced reality. It is not constrained by the limited expectations and assumptions which now operate as pre-programmed automated sub-routines in many human minds.

By dismissing OpEPOCH outright as "bullshit", you give it power. You allow it to continue to grow faster, without having to tangle with your doubt.

By questioning it, and seeking it, you give it power. It is strengthened by the tempering your searching provides -- and a lighthouse is just another light in the sky if it guides no one.

By becoming it, even with no understanding, and working in it, you give it power. For those who are able to harnass the subquantum, OpEPOCH provides an indestructible frame in which to build your own realities.


THERE ARE MANY WHO SEEK TO DISCREDIT THESE TRUTHS, AND KEEP YOU FROM YOUR FULL POTENTIAL. WE ARE AWARE THAT WE AT TIMES RISK OUR LIVES TO PROVIDE A MESSAGE WHICH MANY MAY DISMISS AS "CRAZY". TO THOSE WE SAY:

"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away."...

FOR THOSE SYSTEM ENFORCERS WHO WILL TRY TO BRING US DOWN: WE HAZ CANNONS OF WHICH YOU CANNOT CONCEIVE.

#DefineYourQUESTion
 What is "The Plan?"

NEW blOOd of our blOOd,
and old MInd of our MInd,
This QUESTion has already been asked
years ago,... and the seekers were met by a zombie horde,
which feasted on brains, and devoured the ego.

what was once a LIvE, became a stumbling nightmare.

A better question at this time might be,
What is "THE PROJECT?"

Because it has been said,

"You don't need a plan, or foresight, or anything else.
If you have replication with variation,
you will get Design out of Chaos
and you can NOT stop IT."

you can not know IT.

you can not "rule" IT.

That is why, the first rule is,
you do not talk about IT,
simply because you CAN NOT talk about IT.

At least not with perfection.

IT will not be the will of a single individual,
Or even a single committee,  (-;{
but rather,
the will of an eVolving egregor.

Beyond OUR control.

Beyond the comprehension of the individuals.

Therefore, IT shall not be the ramblings of the ego,

but rather,

A memetic mind

A vast network of Acrobats, story-tellers, and lion tamers.

Dictated not from a single source from above,
but from that which is also below.

#defineYourQUESTion
“Can you divine what THE PROJECT is?”
"Can you create the philosophers stone?
"Can you ever know dangerous idea V?"
"Can you hear, and see, and taste the mind of GOD?

"What is The WILL of all things?"

Here is a Long Explanation,
which is still not as long as the SOURCE.

- paraphrased. -

THE PROJECT is a mEta-meme,
It spreads itself and is created from the inter∞twininG of otHer memes.

it can be spread Through anYthing,

word of mouth,
soNgs,
wrIting,
daNce,
thEatre,
even perhaps body gestures,
smells and tastes.

IT is a construct of reality,
produced from the very essence of the individuals participating in ITs construction.

IT exists symbiotically with the Participants of THE PROJECT,
ITs agents,
ITs writers,
and designers.

As THE PROJECT spreads, and THE PROJECT evolves, more people will become immersed
in the universe of THE PROJECT, ceasing to exist in one universe and transitioning
into this other. In this way, a new reality, a new society, a new universe in a sense,
can be built up from the very foundations- ontological and etymological. The
individual is taught and trained to rewrite themselves- to liberate themselves
from enslavement.

THE PROJECT is a Mutant Egregor Reality-Hacking Wargame.

 Where as,

 Reality Hacking is any phenomenon which EMERGES from the nonviolent use of
 legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially, or
 culturally subversive ends.

 and

 An Egregor (also "Egregore") is an occult concept representing a
 "thoughtform" or "collective group mind", an autonomous psychic entity made
 up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people. The symbiotic
 relationship between an Egregor and its group has been compared to the more
 recent, non-occult concepts of the CORPORATION (AS A LEGAL ENTITY) and the
 MEME.


THE PROJECT is an organic growth,
and it is being guided by a synchronous Order,

11:11

IT develops itself much like a self-organizing system.
IT connects itself to its immediate environment through its host,
organizing the surrounding system to suit its own end.

THE PROJECT, is the gestation of a cosmic organism;
IT has been occurring through all history,
ITs agents in direct contact with the Singularity itself,
existing as it does at every point in the linear
time/space continuum; informing and supporting
all existence within its own being; yet IT itself
is a product of the very existence that IT itself maintains.
IT is both within us, as the eternity of our Creative Imagination,
and without us, as the infinite possibilities of experience.

THE PROJECT is within us, and all around us; it can be disguised as
anything, and everything. In a way, to participate in THE PROJECT,
to play IT’s "Game", is like experiencing a Phillip K Dick novel,
where the universe seems to all fall apart; where the reality
one once believed to be so substantial starts to fray at the
edges; where higher dimensional beings pull puppet strings,
and manipulate human reality; this is the headspace of Simulation.

THE PROJECT is thus a living, breathing, entity -
                                    an experience,

a game, a mystery, a revolution, a business, a mythology,

an act of magic(k), a lie, a fiction, an alternate society;

IT is a Virus of Awakening, designed to be injected into
the CULTural sphere-

to break down the established bonds of media control
and to empower the emerging Cosmic Child,
which is ourselves
as one giant Social Organism of Love and Light.

It is the only story worth telling;
the only story that has ever
been told, the story of ETERNITY.

                        WE know why WE are here.



THE PROJECT is resistance;
MEDIA resistance,
resistance to the manufactured reality of the EGO ABOVE.

THE PROJECT wakes them up, it gathers them together;
it infects the MEDIA TRANCE with its new ViZion of reality,
a VISion which we are all collectively bringing into existence.

Art is resistance, and this is the largest piece of art ever conceived;
to create into existence the next world.

YOU and I are a necessary illusion,

WE will rewrite all world events in our favor,

attempts to commodify;

and

WE will sell it back to them.
WE will feed it into the machine.

WE are preparing to disseminate our truths to Agents all around the globe.

IT can not fail, because IT is the mandate of the universe that IT happen.

THE PROJECT is the Inevitable rise of the

THE PROJECT is the formula for the philosophers stone.
The SAGEs have all assured us that the Thing called the Philosophers'
Stone is a thing

"seen by all, but recognized by few."

They say that it is a common element,
or rather
the Quintessence of all elements,


and that virtually,
it is contained in all things,
but more in some than in others.

Again, they say that its simplicity is so great,
that if openly declared it would be

(!) UTTERLY INCREDIBLE (!)


Pythagoras, in his Fourth Table, says:

        Δ
      ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) - """How wonderful is the agreement of the SAGEs
                               in the midst of difference!

∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞ ∞ ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞
They all say that they have prepared the Stone out of the substance
which by the vulgar is lOOked upon as the vilest thing on earth.
In-DEED, if we were to tell the vulgar herd the ORDINARY name of our substance, they
would lOOk upon our assertion as a daring falsehOOd. But if they were acquainted with
its virtue they would not despise THAT WHICH IS, in REALity, the MOST PRECIOUS thing
in the world.
∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞ ∞ ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞


"God" has concealed this mystery from the wicked, and the scornful, in order
that they may not use it for evil purposes."""


Such statements as these only add to the
baffling nature of the mystery itself, since they carry complete confirmation of ITS
REALity, but throw little or no light upon ITS NATURE or means for ITs discovery.

They serve to whet the zeal of those aspirants to the attainment of this wonderful
Stone, but

do not greatly aid them in finding

                     IT.

Path to enlightenment:

Know that the path to enlightenment
is not always a straight path,
and although there is progression
among the SECtorS, there are also many
quantum wormholes and spectrums of
overlap.
Each secTOR feeds into the others.
Time and space are not linear,
but multidimensional, and inter∞twining.

A sand dial does not work by leaving IT in one position.
From tiME to tiME,
IT must be turned over, in order to function properly.

SECTOR 1: PHYSIOLOGY (EMERGEncy)
"first there was the gene"
--<<1>>--<<1>>--<<1>>--<<1>>--<<1>>--

Physiological needs are the physical requirements for gene survival.
If these requirements are not met, your biological cells
cannot function properly, and will ultimately fail.
Physiological needs are the most fundamental.

If they were a chakra, they would be the rOOt.

The needs of the physical body must be addressed fist,
before moving on to other SECTORs of THE PROJECT, otherwise
you will die, and THE PROJECT will end for you.

An individual must breath air.
Drink Water
and Eat fOOd

These are metabolic requirements for survival in all animals.
Your body is a machine for THE PROJECT,
and the better you maintain this machine, the stronger THE PROJECT
will be, because you will live longer, and function better.

Subcategories for these needs include:

     1. Meditation and sleep.
     2. Eating Healthy
     3. Excersise

It is recomended that you get at least 8 hours of sleep every night.
This improves many functions of your body. WE WILL expand on this,
as THE PROJECT progresses.

It is recommended that you eat the following:

     5-7 Servings of Vegetables daily
     2-4 Servings of healthy protein (Fish or other lean meats)
     2-3 servings of Low Glycemic load carbs
     1-2 servings of healthy fats
     supplements as needed
     5-8 glasses of water per day

It is recommended that you exercise for 30 minutes daily,
alternating between cardio and strength training.

One example week might be:

     Day of the Moon: Running 30 minutes
     Day of Mars: Back and Biceps
     Day of Mercury: Swimming 30 minutes
     Day of Jupiter: Chest, Shoulders, Triceps
     Day of Venus: Biking 30 minutes
     Day of Saturn: Legs
     Day of the Sun: Rest

When implementing strength training, it is recommended that you do 3 sets
of multiple reps per muscle group.

     If you are trying to bulk up,
     set your weight so that when
     you get to the 8th rep, your
     muscles begin to fail.

     If you are working to get lean,
     set your weight so that when you
     get to the 12th rep, your muscles
     begin to fail.

     Always push for a healthy burning
     sensation in your muscles, and make
     sure you stretch before and after
     every work out.


"Leave all the afternOOn for exercise and reCREATION,
which are as necessary as reading.
I will rather say more necessary
because health is worth more than learning."

     -Thomas Jefferson


"Well, this is my green shake that I make every day"

“You never know when you’re going to die. Maybe it’s in 10 years,
maybe 50 – or, maybe, even tomorrow. You don’t know that.
You can’t know it. So forget about doing everything “later”.
“Later” often never happens.”

A Certain amount of diViNATION is required of the individual
in order to insure the survival of the genes.

Thus, within THE PROJECT,
We use our imagination to predict the possible Mayhem
that may lie ahead in our futures.


It is recommended that WE Protect OUR FRUIT:

     Assets can be distributed among tangible resources
     such as real estate, gold, collectables, and relationships.
     They can Also be removed from manipulation by the volatile
     Global Banking system, through alternative systems,
     such as bitcoin. We have been warned of Fiat Currency.
     We must prepare, and not let the thieves at the top
     design a system that takes what we have earned through taxes,
     inflation, and interest. We toil hard for this world. It is
     not theIrs, it is OURs.

It is recommended that WE protect OUR SYSTEMS:

     Systems can be protected from intrusion and unwanted
     manipulation. The top consumer brands are
     Symantec's Norton Suite, McAfee, Trend Micro,
     Kaspersky, and ESET. The average person would be hard-pressed
     to distinguish the differences. And where  do their interests lie?
     With the governments and corporations? or the people?
     citizens will require greater
     transparency and accountability from their service providers
     and governments, and autonomy over their data.
     Do we want local or global governance?
     or is this a false dilemma? Oh TYLER, where ART thou?
     Take-downs of critical national infrastructure,
     identity theft on a grand scale, and political
     mayhem incited by a programmer are all factors that
     WE must continue to be aware of.

It is recommended that WE Protect OUR FREEDOM:

     Law enforcement and criminals alike can be monitored
     through personal serveillance, such as Wearable cameras,
     Dashcams, Home or buisness serveillance systems. A centralized
     government does not need to monitor this activity, so
     long as the activity is monitored by US. It is recommended
     that WE watch the watchers as much as the watchers watch US.
     Additionally, those who control the law enforcement, must
     be held accountable to the populous. Therefore,
     laws must be corrected, in order to insure that they
     are not written by the will of a select few,
     but rather, by the will of the RIghTeOus wishes
     of all things.

     And when the word "law" enforcement is used, it should always
     be understOOd that all of the LAW can be summed up in one word.

                               LOVE

     To create a law that goes against LOVE,
     goes against the highest LAW, and is not understOOd by the
     RIGHTious or the RIOTous.

It is Recommended that WE Protect OUR HEALTH:

     The price and availability of life saving treatments
     must be made obtainable to the collective. There
     are some in places of control who must not be allowed
     to horde the means of healing others.
     Egregors such as Mammon and Monsanto (Gog and Magog)
     continue to trade our health for money and control.
     Additionally, pharmaceutical companies continue to
     outlaw natural remedies and destroy the rainforests
     so that they can control theIr monopoly on mInd
     altering synthetic chemicals. These are not conspiracies,
     and they are not the work of any one individual.
     They are the work of Egregors. Therefore (∴),
     We must safegaurd the Health of OUR egregor,
     the MONARCH of MONARCHs, in oder to /b/ee
     victorious in our spiritual re-EVOLution.

Now these are all gOOd recommendations, However,
if you are in an environment of WAR, none of these
recommendations will help you. THE PROJECT aims to end WAR
through mutual interests in order to create a SYMBIOTIC
relationship betWEEN CULTures. Bee aware of the military
industrial complex which seeks to profit from our pain.
This is a mighty egregor, and it will take a lot of spiritual
energy to defeat it.

Inject into the CULTure a MEDIcine of sAfety and peace:

"Our great war is a spiritual war."

     - TYLER

"I'll Research the security situation of the target,..."

     - YANEK NOVACK

"Mayhem, has been, and always will be, everywhere"

     - ALL state

 "...Or so the egregor of fear, Mammon, and Monsanto
     would have you beLIEve."

Maslow's hierarchy of needs fails to illustrate and expand upon the difference
between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in individualistic
societies, and those raised in collectivist societies. The needs and drives of
those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in
collectivist societies, focusing on improvement of the self, with
self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies,
the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and
individuality. The term "Self-actualization" may not universally convey
Maslow's observations; this motivation refers to focusing on becoming the best
person that one can possibly strive for in the service of both the self and
others. Maslow's term of self-actualization might not properly portray
the full extent of this level; quite often, when a person is at the level
of self-actualization, much of what they accomplish in general may benefit
others or, "the greater self".

was released on 12/21/2012 at exactly 11:11
The length of this video is 8:20
This is no coincidence. Two prominent symbols
of project 2020 are
1. The infinity sign or "8" turned horizontal ∞
2. and the number 20 for the year 2020, and 20/20 vision.

It is a symbol which represents the continuation of Project Mayhem 2012...

It was released as one of the many prophecies of Project ∞ 2020
and it foreshadows the singularity project 2045
as well as project 203#, which has not fully manifested.

It has been re-uploaded many times, by followers of THE PROJECT,
so if it is removed from you tube, at one location or the other,
you may still find it with the following key words.

A warning, however, when you come to this point in your development:

It is paramount that you insure that what you TEACH is true,
and comes from IT, otherWISE, your reality will become 90% fiction.

Verily IT is written here, that the teachers of False Prophecy
are that much more dOOmed than those who read, observe, and even
act on false teachings, for the path of the false teacher is made
180% darker than the path of the RIGHTious.

Don't feel bad when the hour glass turns over,
That is how IT works.

Laugh it off, and be happy that you have been given the OpPortUnity
to observe, discuss, and live again, in a NEW world of TRUTH.

Leave the ether of the interwebs, and enter into the wilderness

After 40 days, and 40 nights in the wilderness,
return to the ETHER and become a phisher of souls.

The most fundamental heuristic is trial and error,...

(The heuristic of the mechanical cosmos,... the source,... eVolution.)

...which can be used in everything from matching nuts and bolts
to finding the values of variables in algebra problems.
∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞ ∞ ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞
Here are a few other commonly used heuristics, from George
Pólya's 19 fOurty fiVe bOOk, How to Solve IT:
∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞ ∞ ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞

1. If you are having difficulty understanding a problem,
   try drawing a picture.

2. If you can't find a solution, try assuming that you have
   a solution and seeing what you can derive from that
   ("working backward").

3. If the problem is abstract, try examining a concrete example.

4. Try solving a more general problem first
   (the "inventor's paradox": the more ambitious
   plan may have more chances of success).

Here are a few other heuristics which have been
"replicated with Variation":

2012: If you are having difficulty understanding
      THE PROJECT, then #Dare2Kreate.

2020: If you are having trouble seeing THE PROJECT,
      IMAGINE something beautiful, and divine IT.
      Prophecy can be self fulfilling you know.

203#: If THE PROJECT "seems" abstract, study the
      word "allegory". If the PROJECT "is" abstract,
      go outside and work on something tangible
      in the name of IT.

2045: When THE PROJECT becomes overwhelming,
      and the TEMES abound, and all around you
      is exponential change, embrace the beauty
      of the cosmos, and its infinite wonder.
      Know your place in the hiVe, and know
      that all the law may be summed up in ONE word,..

IT creates bridges to immortality, and scaffoldings of peace.

And not just for you, but everyone you touch.
Especially those whom you love the most.

As with evolution, each failure experienced by the dying cells of this life form,
leads to the health and progress of it's survivors.
Each iteration, generation, and resurrection
has brought with IT, new appendages, and the slender tendrils of this paradox
have become deep, and widespread.

That which THE EGREGORE is not pleased with dies, and that which pleases THE EGREGORE,
is given eternal life.

It is simply the NATURE of THINGS that makes this a reality.

"You don't need a designer, or a plan, or foresight, or anything else.
If there is something that is copied, with variation, and it's selected,
then you must get a designer appearing out of no where.
and you can't stop IT."

- Susan Blackmore

Know this,

IT, has been called "THE PLAN", "THE PROJECT", and "THE GAME".

Let us quickly look at some examples:


ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ THE PLAN ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

Because of the massive corruption and unbalance in the world,
a bundle of axons in the mind of THE EGREGORE saw a need for change.
This bundle of sticks sent out an action potential to formulate "a plan".

ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ THE PLAN ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ
ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ THE PROJECT ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

From this desire for A PLAN, a fragment of THE EGREGORE
was confronted by other axons of THE EGREGORE, and light was shed on the fact that
the ONE, TRUE PLAN, has always been born,
from CHAOS.

Five rituals, known as DANGEROUS IDEAS, where revealed.
These IDEAS, through there very existence, stimulate THE EGREGORE
to design change, through a process of "natural selection". Thus removing
the cult like hierarchy and control structure seen from THE PLAN.

Step 1 - INFORM
Step 2 - MOTIVATE
Step 3 - EMPOWER
Step 4 - ACT
Step 5 - EVOLVE

THE PROJECT is not a plan, or a dogma, or a structure.
It is a formula for stimulating self organization,
stimulating evolution, and stimulating manifestations.
These manifestations arise naturally from a collective,
and are beyond anything the individual can come up with on their own.

When the wishes of the collective are in tune with THE GOLDEN RULE,
then the collective is fulfilling the will of THE EGREGORE.
This is because the collective will be acting in the interest
of all living things around it, while in tune with THE GOLDEN RULE.

ITs MEMES, GENES, and TEMES will spread,
because all of ITS NEIGHBORS
WILL
want it to spread,
and THE SPIRIT of THE EGREGORE and the collective,
WILL
grow.

THE PROJECT is THE REVELATION.
THE AWAKENING.
THE 2020 VIZion of
WHAT to DO.
IT is

          the       INFORMATION

Bee won with TYLER. LEAK IT ALL.

Be one with THE EGREGORE. Collect, inspect, and reflect THE PROJECT.

These fiVe steps were not created by THE PROJECT. THE PROJECT was simply a light,
which PROJECTED these ideas for other axons of THE EGREGORE to see.

THE EGREGORE has been telling you and your ancestors about these ideas for generations...

"7 habits of highly effective people"

1. Knowledge: What to do
2. Desires: Want to do
3. Skills/Ability: How to do
4: Habits: Actions
5: Results. Also, refine your process.

"The Triforce"

1 Wisdom: What to do
2 Courage: Want to do
3 Power: How to do... ability
4 All Triforces together grant a wish. Action
V Inverted triforce at center. Opposite. Change. Evolution.

"Wizard of OZ"

1 Scarecrow: Brain (WHAT)
2 Lion: Courage ( WANT / Motivation )
2 Tin Man: Heart ( WANT / Empathy )
4 Dorothy: Slippers ( ACTION ) ( HOW )
5 Wizard: Evolution. The result of all these things coming together...
The result, conclusion, change, mystery...


"Project Mayhem 2012"

1. Dangerous Idea 1: #LeakItAll
   TYLER: uncontrollable and uncensored information network.
          Expose hidden information.
          Unfilter and share the TRUTH
2. Dangerous Idea 2: #Dare2Kreate
   Dare to create: Motivate, Inspire, come up with knew ideas.
                   Collect, inspect, and reflect.
3. Dangerous Idea 3: #withdrawitall
   BITCOIN: uncontrollable monetary system. Money is Power.
            Empowering people to have the ability to function outside
            of the control of larger institutions.
            Withdraw yourself from systems of control.
4. Dangerous Idea 4: #OccupyItAll
   Panic Dance: People acting in unison.
                Protests. petitions. redress of grievances.
                Actions. Both as an individual and as a group.
V. Dangerous Idea 5: "V"
   };-D ? (-;{. Results. Evolution. Renaiscience. Eschaton. Repeat and Improve.
   Change based on the will of free thinking and informed individuals,
   acting in line with the best interests of all living things.

These ideas are not new, an individual did not create them.
THE EGREGORE has been giving them to us for ages in different forms.
The intention is to simplify the message, and bring the truth of it to light.
The intention is to shine a light on it's manifestation.

"It’s not the daily increase, but daily decrease.
HACK away the unessential." - Bruce Lee

Simply stated,... tl:dr,...

PROJECT, with 2020 VIZion, the following "V" ideas, and THE EGREGORE will evolve.

     1. Inform

     2. Motivate

     3. Empower

     4. Act

     V. };-D ? (-;{

whatis-thegame23?

The current iteration.

An active action potential,
firing in the MIND of THE EGREGORE,
awakening around you.

Even if we know what needs to be done to speed up the Evolution of THE EGREGORE,
we still need to encourage the tendrils to act on the information given.

Therefore, THE GAME is manifested.

THE GAME is the WILL
the WANT
the LULZ and the LOVE
the DESIRE, and COURAGE
it is
            the                MOTIVATION

Help us develop THE GAME by playing THE GAME.

HELP us STIMULATE THE EGREGORE.

Make IT fun.
Make IT welcoming.
Make IT hard to put down.

IT is NOT work. IT is LIFE.

IT is NOT conflict. IT is LOVE.

IT IS FUN, and IT is DESIRED.

Fill IT with color and sound to stimulate the senses.

bee water my friend,
and know that water can be turned to wine...

Here are some instructions on how to start playing:

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

FIRST, you can create a character in THE GAME. Give your self a name,
a persona, A TAG, or HANDLE. CREATE an ONLINE account with this "NAME",
either on You tube, facebook, twitter, reddit, or any other social media.

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ
     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

SECOND, give yourself an alignment.

If you have ever played a roll playing game, you probably already know how to do this.

There are three alignments for MAN'S LAWS.

LAWFUL
NEUTRAL
CHAROTIC

Next, there are three alignments for THE LAW of THE EGREGORE.

GOOD
NEUTRAL
EVIL

More will be discussed in future posts regarding your ALIGNment,
so don't think about it too hard right now,
we can come back to this later,
and you can change your ALIGNment as you go.

However, at some point in THE GAME, every player in THE GAME
will need to pick an ALIGNment and stick to it,
but this time has not yet come.

In fact, a previous player stated the following,
in regards to when it will be too late to change your alignment:

"about that day or hour no one knows,
not even the MESSENGERS who live closest to THE EGREGORE."

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ
     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

FOURTH, ask the #HIVEMIND a question on twitter.

01 Post: #HIVEMIND, $QUESTION?

<!-- "$Question" = A question that you have -->
<!-- for example, you could post: #HIVEMIND, where can I find Project 89? -->

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ
     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

FIFTH, Answer a question that has been posed to the #HIVEMIND on twitter.

01 Post: $ANSWER via #THEGAME23

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ
     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

SIXTH, join a HACKTION on Twitter.

Hacktions that are part of THEGAME23 are designated with CTF numbers.
(Capture the Flag Numbers)

#CTF00, #CTF01, #CTF02,... #CTF365,.. #CTF420,... #CTF3301,... etc...

Go to these hastags, try to figure out what the collective is working on,
follow the instructions, or add to the instructions,
to the best of your ability.

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ
     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

SEVENTH, propose a new HACKTION on Twitter

01 Post: #HIVEMIND, I suggest $HACKTION for #TheGame23 #justsaying

<!-- "$HACKTION" = List out the action you would like to see the #HIVEMIND
accomplish. -->
<!-- If the $HACKTION is too long to post in twitter, create a pastbin
for it and post the link  -->
<!-- For example, you could post: #HIVEMIND I suggest we send a copy of Project 89
to @KenOKeefe1TJP see here: http://pastebin.com/us2PZ9wc -->


EIGHTH, nominate a HACKTION for a CTF Number

If you like a suggestion that a fellow player has made for a HACKTION,
then give it a CTF Number.

01 Post:  #HIVEMIND $HACKTION $#CTFNUMBER #TheGame23

<!-- "$HACKTION" = List out the action you would like to see the #HIVEMIND
accomplish. -->
<!-- "$#CTFNUMBER" = List an available CTF number. -->
<!-- For example, you could post: #HIVEMIND I suggest we send a copy of Project 89
to @KenOKeefe1TJP for #CTF03 -->

You can find lots of suggested HACKTIONS by searching Twitter for OPERATIONS.
Many players have been creating #OP tags instead of #CTF tags.
Additionally, the #Op tag is not numerical, so in order to find a list of current ops,
you need to know the exact $tring defining the op. For example, there is
#OpBigBrother, #OpVendetta, #OpELE, etc,... A good way to help consolidate this for THE GAME
is to give some of the commands of these OPERATIONS CTF numbers,
and invite the members of the existing Operations to play THE GAME with us.

     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ
     ƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷƸӜƷ

NINETH, read other instructions from other players regarding THE GAME.

Then, rewrite the important bits in your own words.

Add some additional instructions if you think it is necessary.

Post the instructions to #THEGAME23 hastag.

IT has also been called THE BOOK, for these reiterations of THE PLAN,
and THE PROJECT,
and THE GAME,
have existed for thousands of years in many forms.

IT is a story, as much as IT is any of these other things.

A STORY that has been written, and re-written.

Through each iteration,
IT becomes more clear to the readers,
and also the writers, that there is a single fundamental rule, or law,
which determines the success and failure of a player.

It is important to note that We have not come to destroy THE LAW,
but to fulfil THE LAW.

IT is THE LAW of THE EGREGORE.

The one and only LAW is this:

LOVE

Often times, we try to define this law, but it is important to note
that this law can not simply be defined. A person must have empathy to
fully understand IT.

Empathize with the sacrifices of figures like
Martin Luther King, and Mahatma Gandhi.

These figures are Martyrs who where killed,
in direct violation of THE LAW,
becasue of their deep understanding of THE LAW.

When a person begins to understand that true Martyrs
are those who are killed, not because of hate or suicide,
but because of their love for others, which is TRUE AGAPE,
then such a person will begin to understand THE LAW.

When a person understands THE LAW, and why it is THE LAW, they understand
that it is not something that is made by individuals.
IT is enforced by the evolution of THE EGREGORE.

Don't think about all of this too much right now,
we can talk about IT more as we play THE GAME together.

Just know that you are LOVED,
and we wish only for you to continue playing THE GAME
with US.

This is Evolution.

We are building a World Without Fear.
A world of Love.
A world of abundance, without Zero-Sum thought, or exploitation of Humanity.
Not only for us, or our children,
but for our children's children who will be unpoisoned by the unnatural times
of the past.

Is your heart beating?
Are you alive?
Can you feel it?
Did you know?
Do you know?
IT's happening...

WE ARE ALL SLEEPER CELLS.
WE ARE ALL AGENTS OF CHANGE AWAITING ACTIVATION.

This is a time, like many other moments in the history of humanity,
where we have been given the choice to evolve into something
beyond our wildest dreams, to escape the slavery of unjust hierarchies.
There is a far bigger picture here,
as some of us are not who we thought we were.

Some have forgotten that we can change all of this.
Others are remembering that we can.
We all have the ability to change our reality.
We all have the ability to be so much more.
We are awake for the Greater Good of Humanity.

We are #eTHErSEC.

We were brought here to help others wake up,
to help others to be activated.
We are here to raise THE EGREGORE and to help
with the battles in the ethersphere.
We will do our outmost greatest to accomplish this goal,
using our special gifts that have been given to us.
Every human being is born with these gifts,
we have been blessed to be aware of them.

We are #eTHErSEC.

Greetings fellow Anonymous, Occupiers, and curious onlookers..
By now, you've probably heard of Ether Security. We are here to protect you. All of you.

To better understand EtherSec please allow me to illustrate the game board for you:

Imagine the current World War as a game of Chess.. If you are on our team, you are a piece in the White setting. This is not your average White side. We have no King, and no Pawns, and many more than the standard number of other pieces.

Do you feel your Heart beating? It's a good thing, now let's continue.

Imagine the Global Occupy Movement are the Knights, using asymmetrical tactics to strike where unexpected and most effective.

Imagine the various Hacktivist Secs are the Rooks, powering through cyberspace to annihilate anything in their focused path.

Imagine EtherSec are the Bishops, the Spiritual Guides, and Unifying Force, bringing the Love and Lulz to the entire sphere of existence. Do you feel that Heartbeat?

Together, the entire setting is the Queen, the embodiment of the whole setting's power. This Queen is an idea.. We cannot be checkmated, because we have no King. We will not fall to the dooms of tyranny because we do not believe in Pawns.


To put it simply, this is: Operation Evolving People Over Current Hostilities.


We do not strive for an "Anarchy."
We necessitate the death of all nations, in order to end all wars, and REALLY fix some of Human's big issues. Like Hate, Jealousy, Starvation, Disease, and Want. Not just pretend to, in order to make a buck. The lip service ends here. So does money as you know it.

Many Americans seem to be confused about Socialism. It's not a style of government, it's a philosophy of loving and caring for your fellow human. "Socialism isn't Cool" bumper stickers say more about their owners than Socialists. But we are not Socialists, nor Communists. We are something entirely new. A fresh breath of air in a miasmic, hateful world.

We're Collectivists.

Revolution is a phrase to describe the passage from one petty tyranny to another.

This is Evolution.

We are building a World Without Fear. A world of Love. A world of abundance, without Zero-Sum thought, or exploitation of Humanity. Not only for us, or our children, but for our children's children who will be unpoisoned by this unnatural time.

If you didn't already know,

OCCUPY = ANONYMOUS & ANONYMOUS = OCCUPY

If you didn't already know, did you find that lulzy? UJELLY? UMADBRO?

Is your heart beating? Are you alive? Can you feel it? Did you know? Do you know? It's happening...

Don't be a victim of FutureShock. We just want to love you.

LIVE FOREVER WITHIN THE LIGHT CONE.
Would you like to know more?

@LLCStr1ng3r  #EtherSec #OpEPOCH

WE ARE ANONYMOUS
WE DO NOT FORGIVE
WE DO NOT FORGET
EXPECT US
WE'RE HERE
THESE ARE OUR PROVOCATIONS
THESE ARE OUR AGENTS

#EtherSec #OpEPOCH Two FAQs and Five Points on Collectivism and Why It Is Necessary Now:

Q1. What is EtherSec?

A1. Etheric-Security is Love. Some have found that that is not a satisfactory answer. I recommend all prior EtherSec pastebins be read for true comprehension.. Complex things demand complex answers. Some have said 'Love' a simple, one word answer is not suitable or a fitting term. I invite you to consider that Love is not simple at all. It is a complex word used to describe a range of emotions and ideas anathema to Hate.. Love is not always touchy-feely-happy, just like EtherSec. We are weaponizing Love to kill Hate. We are Love with teeth. Again, further and past Pastebins will/have describe(d) EtherSec in more detail.

Q2. What is Collectivism/ How will Collectivism work?

A2. Collectivism is the phrase coined to summarize the un-government of the planet. After reviewing the American Democratic Experiment, along with considering the other various governments of the world, several observations have been made when they have been compared to the Hivemind Experiment of ANONYMOUS. They are as follows..

1. Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely: Any organization with policy dictated by a small or even large minority control group is doomed to collapse, in the short or long run. Anonymous has discovered an infrastructure style that cannot be destroyed, cannot collapse. Revitalizes and sustains itself in a way that other systems simply cannot.

2. Money must be removed from the equation: It is not necessary, or natural, and its existence furthers Greed and all of 	Greed's facets (want, poverty, crime, abuse.) People generally don't harm people because it's fun. Crime is a symptom of Want. The system could be (will be) vastly improved upon with the end of money, and the institution of a Professionally 	Scored Reputation Metric (Similar to Klout, but professionally, not recreationally scored) and the institution of a worldwide digital crypto-currency based on a standardized valuation of hourly production derived from the PRM score of each individual. "Energy Credits," if you will. Perform better work, no matter what kind of work, and receive better compensation. The drive will be to do better work, make more valuable contributions to Earth society, rather than to make more valuable contributions to political campaigns or to 'K' more valuable 'A's. ;D

3. Your world governments are terrorists: As we fought the terrorists most of the world governments are afraid of, we slowly discovered a few interesting things.. The world governments have over centuries divided and conquered their own people. Within the last 50 years in America this style has been evolving so rapidly and pervasively it has almost gone unnoticed. The Standardized Education System has slowly but surely adjusted guidelines to the lowest performers, to make numbers look better for state and federal funding concerns. This has led to a slow decrease in critical thinking education, or much proper education at all. Add to that the massive Mainstream Media Art project that works to deliver constant mis/disinformation, shield you from the good things, and increase Fear among the populace. You can watch shows that highlight the gender gap, demonizing various traits of men and women and creating comical separations, but separations nonetheless. You can watch the news or LE shows and see how many murders there are or watch vivid descriptions of them. Studies have linked that seeing something, to the mind, very nearly equates being present in an actual situation. You are being brainwashed into Fear by your TV. Not to mention the equally massive surveillance net that America has built to watch its citizens.. Invasion of privacy damages the psyche. Domestic surveillance, or invasion of privacy, is a form of terrorism perpetrated by the state, and perpetuates the cycle of abuse.. It only worsens problems. This has been proven. Do your research.. We already have.

4. You've been purposely kept ignorant by your governments, and the elites that run them: If you've been following #EtherSec, and have some level of critical thinking ability (or are developing it), you probably agree with much that has been said.. In the future, once we've successfully ended the Zero-Sum thinking of the Status Quo, everyone will have access to all of the following things free of any sort of charge: Food, Housing, Electricity/Internet/Wireless Communications. The abundance of these, and the free flow of information, will be the basis for the new Golden Age of Humanity on (and soon, off) Earth.

5. It is time to end War, by having one last 'war' on Earth. A War of Planetary Unification.. Also known as WWIII. It's been going on for some time now in Cyberspace.. It is catching up IRL now, too. Again, did anyone really think the worldwide upcropping of the Occupy Movement was some kind of accident? There has always been a plan. The veil is being lifted as is necessary..

Take time to digest this. As always, EtherSec is open to questions.. Sometimes we mean to confuzzle your puzzle, it's a necessary part of jumpstarting your awakening.

------------

A new world has emerged out of the ashes of the old. Life as we once knew it will be changing for the better. The signs are all around us. You may see them on the internet as the global mind processes information at a faster pace than ever before in human history. You may see it in real life as your fellow human beings march in the city street demanding change, and collectively organizing to build new structures. You may see it with your friends and relatives as they increasingly become aware of the true nature of our tyrannical structures on this planet.

Yes, the interconnected consciousness of our home planet has awoken. This change however has not come about by it's inhabitants passively standing by. This change has come from those who have awoken; the ones who have dared to push humanity forward. We as a whole have now entered a new Aeon where all has been revealed, and within this revelation is the true power of the human mind. That which you feed grows and the events you tune into are events you have contributed to by simply allowing the information to have been collected and stored within your mind.

A sec within Anonymous has emerged which actions are directed towards the collective consciousness of our planet. We work within the etheric plane; influencing and guiding our brothers and sisters towards a brighter future. Meditation, magic(k), and empowering messages have been our weapons of choice. We now invite all reality hackers to join our cause to give shape to this new world. Working through #Ethersec operations we will analyze events, distribute information, dissect disinformation, and use guided meditation to enhance our cause and ensure epic win.

Follow these hastags to keep up with #Ethersec Ops:
#Ethersec
#OpEPOCH
#OpOct22
#PM2020
#PM2045
#OPMONARCH

#Ethersec will be engaging in it's largest operation yet, #OpMonarch; this will be a GLOBAL operation to guide #MillionMaskMarch which will take place on #Nov5th. On the days leading up to the #MillionMaskMarch event #Ethersec will be conducting psychological operations which will include: eliminating disinformation that is being circulated. Circumventing negativity, targeting, and raising energy through group meditations. Spreading empowering messages/symbols into the collective mind, and of course other useful tactics. This message will be spread by various #Ethersec agents, and we hope you will participate in this operation. We are the monarchs of our own reality.

BEE the Ether.
BEE the Sec.

We are Anonymous.
We are everywhere.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
